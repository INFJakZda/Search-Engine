The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics No matter how well WE do they find fault But the forgotten men women WON I President 
Sorry I got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear bad Trade Deals VA Choice the Economy rebuilding the Military and so much more and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating ClintonRussiaFBIJusticeObamaComeyLynch etc 
Why aren the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton It a Rigged Witch Hunt that why Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration 
The 13 Angry Democrats plus people who worked 8 years for Obama working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the midterm elections especially now that Republicans stay tough are taking the lead in Polls There was no Collusion except by the Democrats 
This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about It wasn just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaignpeople call that Spyingthis is unprecedented and scandalous Mollie Hemingway 
We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit and more Kim Young Chol the Vice Chairman of North Korea heading now to New York Solid response to my letter thank you 
Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama term showing children from the Border in steel cages They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of countryBipartisan Bill 
California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems  along with so many others On June 5th vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX a really good and highly competent man He Make California Great Again 
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts no chance This is too good to be true for RepublicansRemember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS13 gang membersnot good 
Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served They cared for their families more than anything in the world they loved their families They inspired their communities 
The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from poverty 
Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance We are gathered here on the sacred soil of Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America greatest heroes the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom 
We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate or his campaign under investigation That raises legitimate questions I just find this really oddthis goes to the heart of our electoral system Jonathan Turley on 
Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable Jonathan Turley 
The President deserves some answers in discussing SPYGATE 
Happy Memorial Day Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER amp women in 18years rebuilding our Military and so much more Nice 
Why didn President Obama do something about the socalled Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn want to upset the apple cart He was in charge not me and did nothing 
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this It will happen 
Why didn the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia Why didn the FBI take the Server from the DNC Rigged Investigation 
Fantastic to have 400000 GREAT MEN WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in DC showing their patriotism They love our Country they love our Flag they stand for our National Anthem Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller 
Who going to give back the young and beautiful lives and others that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt They journeyed down to Washington DC with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nationThey went back home in tatters 
WELCOME HOME JOSH 
When will the 13 Angry Democrats amp those who worked for President O reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest It been a long time now Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems Justice FBI Russia 
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven been lost in decades 13 Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
With Spies or Informants as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but it not all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn the crooked highest levels of the FBI or Justice contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem 
The Failing quotes a senior White House official who doesn exist as saying even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed WRONG AGAIN Use real people not phony sources 
Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Koreaand if there was it wouldn matter The has called me wrong right from the beginning 
Thanks to very brave Teacher Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world 
Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House The great people of Utah are Celebrating 
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the US Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS13 THUGS 
Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela Should be landing in DC this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 700 PM The great people of Utah will be very happy 
We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June 12th and if necessary will be extended beyond that date 
but complain and obstruct They made only bad deals Iran and their socalled Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world 
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase US parts and pay a 13 Billion fine Dems do nothing 
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States Lost almost 800 Billionyear under O 
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won let them do their job The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop 
To the Class of 2018 I say We know you are up to the task We know you will make us proud We know that glory will be yours Because you are WINNERS you are WARRIORS you are FIGHTERS you are CHAMPIONS and YOU will lead us to VICTORY God Bless the USA 
On behalf of the American People CONGRATULATIONS We love you 
Today it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States in Annapolis Maryland CongratulationsGood luck Godspeed And ANCHORS AWEIGH 
Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea We will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace Only time and talent will tell 
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs saying that they are individuals must be nurtured or asking to end your big Tax Cuts raise your taxes instead Dems have lost touch 
Everyone knows there was a Spy and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a SpyWidespread Spying involving multiple people Mollie Hemingway The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story 
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain And to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money LOST 
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party campaign is different than having a Spy as illegal as that may be But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax 
I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth 
Today welcomed 106yearold Pearl Harbor veteran Ray Chavez of Poway California to the

I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world 
It was my great honor to host a roundtable re MS13 yesterday in Bethpage New York Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPOlaw enforcement and SAVE innocent lives 
WATCH on his decision to cancel the planned North Korea summit
Sadly I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un 
Sadly I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un 
Not surprisingly the GREAT Men Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI 
Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign Large dollars were paid to the Spy far beyond normal Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in US history SPYGATE  a terrible thing 
Will be interviewed on tomorrow morning at 600 AM Enjoy 
Great to be in New York for the day Heading back to the now lots of work to be done 
Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage New York Keep up the great work 
Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities  and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes including the disgraceful practice known as CatchandRelease Democrats must abandon their resistance 
Today on Long Island we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS13 I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union 
Thank you 
WITCH HUNT 
There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries you have waited long enough 
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly After many years RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK 
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion 
Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No James Clapper I am not happy Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot 
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman 
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history 
It clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano 
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before What goes around comes around 
New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign Even Clapper worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities
Follow the money The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia because there was no Collusion He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win  just like they did to Bernie Sanders who got duped 
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered  many times higher than normal 
For the first time since Roe v Wade America has a ProLife President a ProLife Vice President a ProLife House of Representatives and 25 ProLife Republican State Capitals

Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce 
The Wall Street Journal asks WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA A very good question 
they then used to start an investigation about Trump It is that simple This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle This was a Political hit job this was not an Intelligence Investigation Brennan has disgraced himself he worried about staying out of Jail Dan Bongino 
top of the FBI Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony Dossierhe knows about the Dossier he denies knowledge of the Dossier he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier which 
John Brennan is panicking He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the 
China must continue to be strong tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in I want this to happen and North Korea to be VERY successful but only after signing 
On China Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time 
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL FarmAgricultural Products  would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years 
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer why didn President Obama the Democrats do something about Trade with China including Theft of Intellectual Property etc They did NOTHING With that being said Chuck I have long agreed on this issue Fair Trade plus with China will happen 
I hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBIDOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes  and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration 
It is emotional day being back at in celebration of our dear friend Colin He was a beautiful child who we will all
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia  so now they looking at the rest of the World Oh great 
and why hasn the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington DC 
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of Democrats FBI They broke into homes offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server 
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World they should easily be able to take it into the MidTerm Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party Don worry about Dems FISA Abuse missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier 
in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails got 145000000 while Secretary of State paid McCabes wife 700000 and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M and so much more Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam 
At what point does this soon to be 20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren looking at the corruption 
Things are really getting ridiculous The Failing and Crooked but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton has done a long boring story indicating that the World most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia me so now they are looking at the rest of the World 
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee also Senate Judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers Drain the Swamp 
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House Melania is feeling and doing really well Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes

School shooting in Texas Early reports not looking good God bless all 
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president It took place very early on and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a hot Fake News story If true  all time biggest political scandal 
Why isn disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the 700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M under FBI investigation that they killed gave to McCabe wife in her run for office Then dropped case on Clinton 
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants Animals Wrong They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as Animals a big difference  and so true Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual 
Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign This has never been done before and by any means necessary they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn commit David Asman Really bad stuff 
It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center There is nobody like them

Despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in US history  by far Sorry to the Fake News Media and Haters but that the way it is 
Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says There probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate 
Wow word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT Andrew McCarthy says There probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign If so this is bigger than Watergate 
Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American Historyand there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money 
Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately We need her to keep our great country safe 
and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill He also weak on borders and crime Sadly our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr Lou Barletta will win 
Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent Bob Casey has been a donothing Senator who only shows up at election time He votes along the Nancy Pelosi Elizabeth Warren lines loves sanctuary cities bad and expensive healthcare

We have not seen China demands yet which should be few in that previous US Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating China has seen our demands There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe the meetings 
haven even started yet The US has very little to give because it has given so much over the years China has much to give 
The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China 
Congratulations to Deb Fischer The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing  and it showed up at the ballot box

ZTE the large Chinese phone company buys a big percentage of individual parts from US companies This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi 
Big day for Israel Congratulations 
US Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on Lead up to 900 AM eastern event has already begun A great day for Israel 
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris At some point countries will have to open their eyes see what is really going on This kind of sickness hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful successful country Changes to our thought process on terror must be made 
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary Now that will not happen 
China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries But be cool it will all work out 
President Xi of China and I are working together to give massive Chinese phone company ZTE a way to get back into business fast Too many jobs in China lost Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done 
Happy Mother Day 
The Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME Wall and Border Security should be included Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do STAY 
Iran Military Budget is up more than 40 since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reachedjust another indicator that it was all a big lie But not anymore 
North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th Thank you a very smart and gracious gesture 
Why doesn the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration AntiTrust Division has been and is opposed to the ATampT purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial Such a disgrace in reporting

The Fake News is working overtime Just reported that despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy all things else 91 of the Network News about me is negative Fake Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt Take away credentials 
The Republican Party had a great night Tremendous voter energy and excitement and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November The Economy is sooo strong and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes why wouldn we win 
The Iran Deal is defective at its core If we do nothing we know what will happen In just a short time the world leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world most dangerous weapons 
Finally I want to deliver a message to the longsuffering people of Iran The people of America stand with you
At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program
Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal 
John Kerry can get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it Stay away from negotiations John you are hurting your country

The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injusticeand just wait till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest 
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia So now the Probe says OK what else is there How about Obstruction for a made up phony crimeThere is no O it called Fighting Back 
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror Win Gina

despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair Prior to its violation by Ms Clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement Money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction 
very common among celebrities and people of wealth In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms Clifford Daniels The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair 
Mr Cohen an attorney received a monthly retainer not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign from which he entered into through reimbursement a private contract between two parties known as a nondisclosure agreement or NDA These agreements are

A message from Kim Jong Un North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missilesAlso will Shut down a nuclear test site in the country Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests Progress being made for all 
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act Really does everybody know what that means

James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION Also he leaked classified information WOW Will the Witch Hunt continue 
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus Inspector General Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them Getting a little lot of their own medicine 
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed We are doing a great job of law enforcement but things such as this make safety in America difficult 
My thoughts prayers and condolences are with the families friends and colleagues of the two deputies HEROES who lost their lives in the line of duty today 
Mike Pompeo is outstanding First in his class at West Point A top student at Harvard Law School A success at whatever he has done We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP He will be a great Secretary of State 
Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country 
Democrats are obstructing good hopefully great people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government hence the American People They are slow walking all of my nominations  hundreds of people At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals

We in a prime position to defend our majorities in 2018 Let defy history
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the US keeps raising interest rates Not acceptable 
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her lied in Congress to Senator G then based his decisions on her poll numbers Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes 
Just hit 50 in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point With all of the phony stories and Fake News it hard to believe Thank you America we are doing Great Things 
Slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history by far 
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past I have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken All lawyers are deflated and concerned 
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty I hardly even knew this guy Just another of his many lies His memos are self serving and FAKE 
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back Use often 
Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus Why can we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch Was she promised a Supreme Court seat or AG in order to lay off Hillary No golf and grandkids talk give us all a break 
The big questions in Comey badly reviewed book aren answered like how come he gave up Classified Information jail why did he lie to Congress jail why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI why didn they TAKE it why the phony memos McCabe 700000 more 
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the Clinton Email probe In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job Slimeball 
So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the fines
So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had There won be anything or anyone even close 
A perfectly executed strike last night Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military Could not have had a better result Mission Accomplished 
DOJ just issued the McCabe report  which is a total disaster He LIED LIED LIED McCabe was totally controlled by Comey  McCabe is Comey No collusion all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes 
We are bringing back our factories we are bringing back our jobs and we are bringing back those four beautiful words MADE IN THE USA 
untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history It was my great honor to fire James Comey 
James Comey is a proven LEAKER LIAR Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he diduntil he was in fact fired He leaked CLASSIFIED information for which he should be prosecuted He lied to Congress under OATH He is a weak and 
Tremendous pressure is building like never before for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities Started the Wall in San Diego where the people were pushing really hard to get it They will soon be protected

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama Mueller is most conflicted of all except Rosenstein who signed FISA Comey letter No Collusion so they go crazy 
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War There is no reason for this Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together Stop the arms race 
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria Get ready Russia because they will be coming nice and new and smart You shouldn be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it 
doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation which takes tremendous time and focus No Collusion or Obstruction other than I fight back so now they do the Unthinkable and RAID a lawyers office for information BAD

The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border had better be stopped before it gets there Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen Congress MUST ACT NOW 
The Fake News Networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast The Fakers at CNN NBC ABC CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction

Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTAThey have very strong border laws  ours are pathetic With all of the money they make from the US hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until Congress changes our immigration laws 
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon No longer works Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime 
Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People Border Patrol Agents and ICE are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don allow them to do their job Act now Congress our country is being stolen 
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country They must stop them at their Northern Border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws 
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA They want in on the act 
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the US They laugh at our dumb immigration laws They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA NEED WALL 
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal Democrat laws like Catch Release Getting more dangerous Caravans coming Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW NO MORE DACA DEAL

Special Council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I am still opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because 
there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime collusion or otherwise or obstruction of justice So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz 
Special Council is told to find crimes wether crimes exist or not I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council I still am opposed to it I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because

WITCH HUNT 
We seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSIONI have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he exercising his power as the President of the US I just don see it Judge Ken Starr 
I been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year I just don see the evidencein terms of the collusion it all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have Jonathan Turley on 
He got a very good point Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs Clinton criminality at her own hands or through others that ought to be investigated I fully agree with the President on that on Show 
Meritbased immigration reform will benefit American workers and relieve the strain imposed by our current system on Federa

Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts So what else is new He is a total phony 
Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump Of course not because there is none and never was This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgraceand Obama did nothing about Russia 
Dem Memo FBI did not disclose who the clients were  the Clinton Campaign and the DNC Wow 
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done SO ILLEGAL 
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS 93 APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING Thank you 50 say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME funny 79 say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump starting to happen 
Dems are no longer talking DACA Out of sight out of mind they say DACA beneficiaries should not be happy Nancy Pelosi truly doesn care about them Republicans stand ready to make a deal 
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973 Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations 
Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP 
Armed Educators and trusted people who work within a school love our students and will protect them Very smart people Must be firearms adept have annual training Should get yearly bonus Shootings will not happen again  a big very inexpensive deterrent Up to States

Thank you to the great men and women of the United States for a job well done 
Today Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister and Mrs Turnbull of Australia to the Conference 
Our nation motto is IN GOD WE TRUST This week our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean We will never forget the historic crowds the voice the energy and the profound faith of Billy Graham 
We salute our great American flag we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem 
After years of rebuilding OTHER nations we are finally rebuilding OUR nation  and we are restoring our confidence and our pride 
For those of you who are still interested the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA Not a lot of interest on this subject from them 
My daughter Ivanka just arrived in South Korea We cannot have a better or smarter person representing our country 
CPAC Today 
MS13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem We need The Wall 
School shooting survivor says he quit Town Hall after refusing scripted question Just like so much of CNN Fake News That why their ratings are so bad MSNBC may be worse 
Today it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the with State and local leaders law enforcement officers and education officialsThere is nothing more important than protecting our children They deserve to be safe and we will deliver

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue  I hope 
If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school Cowards won go thereproblem solved Must be offensive defense alone won work 
History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes It takes police first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime Highly trained gun adept teacherscoaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive GREAT DETERRENT 
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this Far more assets at much less cost than guards A gun free school is a magnet for bad people ATTACKS WOULD END 
I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience  only the best 20 of teachers a lot would now be able to 
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students teachers and families So much love in the midst of so much pain We must not let them down We must keep our children safeFull Listening Session 
Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham Our prayers are with his children grandchildren greatgrandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry
Yesterday it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers the Medal of Valor 
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren they the subject of the investigation Why didn Obama do something about the meddling Why aren Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Sessions 
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead There was nobody like him He will be missed by Christians and all religions A very special man 
Question If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren they the subject of the investigation Why didn Obama do something about the meddling Why aren Dem crimes under investigation Ask Jeff Session 
Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks
So true thank you 
Bad ratings got scammed when they covered the antiTrump Russia rally walltowall They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise 
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law This shows smallbusiness owners are more than just optimistic they are ready to grow their businesses 
cameras running Another False Accusation Why doesn report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me One had her home mortgage paid off Only so reporteddoesn fit the Mainstream Media narrative 
A woman I don know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago Never happened Who would do this in a public space with live security 
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts Total Fake News 
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary Your Original was correct Don let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste money 
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House You come a long way Matt 
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away Actually they want to raise you taxes substantially Also they want to do nothing on DACA R want to fix 
The President Obama quote just before election That because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn want to rock the boat When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems 
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America elections there no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so I invite Mr Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes  
Thank you to for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia including Crimea Syria and so much more We are now starting to win again 
The Faith of Donald Trump a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb is a very interesting read Enjoy 
The US economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations Taxes have been massively Cut JOBS JOBS JOBS 
has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to and has my full support and endorsement
Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election So why didn he do something about Russian meddling 
Have a great but very reflective President Day 
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others 
My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500 Brian France and the France family are special people Enjoy the race 
Thank you to KenStarr former Independent Counsel Whitewater for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse Russian meddling etc Really great interview with 
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot Big gain over last 4 weeks I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away We need more Republicans 
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN 
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the US then with all of the Committee Hearings Investigations and Party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams They are laughing their asses off in Moscow Get smart America 
Big night Largestever Dallas County GOP Reagan Day Dinner As I told the crowd under President Promise
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats lead by their fearless leader Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election But wasn I a great candidate 
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia  it never did 
Finally Liddle Adam Schiff the leakin monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election He is finally right about something Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing Thank you Adam 
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send 17 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation 
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H the DNC and the Dems Remember the Dirty Dossier Uranium Speeches Emails and the Podesta Company 
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter This is not acceptable They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign  there is no collusion Get back to the basics and make us all proud 
Just like they don want to solve the DACA problem why didn the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House Senate during the Obama Administration Because they didn want to and now they just talk 
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was NOT the main goalRob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads 
The Fake News Media never fails Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads Rob Goldman 
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn know 
Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election 
Charges Deal Don A Big Win written by Michael Goodwin of the succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign She lost the oldfashioned way by being a terrible candidate Case closed 
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida Will never forget them or the evening 
Our entire Nation wone heavy heart continues to pray for the victims their families in Parkland FL To teachers law enforcement first responders medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger We THANK YOU for your courage 
Russia started their antiUS campaign in 2014 long before I announced that I would run for President The results of the election were not impacted The Trump campaign did nothing wrong  no collusion 
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democratstotally abandoned Republicans are still working hard 
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth  but people whose lives have been totally shattered Am also working with Congress on many fronts 
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland Florida 
lottery continues deadly catchandrelease and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement and a vote FOR open borders If Dems are actually serious about DACA they should support the Grassley bill 
The SchumerRoundsCollins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America It creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals doesn build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa 
SchumerRoundsCollins destroys the ability of to enforce immigration laws creating a mass amnesty for over 10 millio
In times of tragedy the bonds that sustain us are those of family faith community and country These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil  and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need 
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA 
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem Must always report such instances to authorities again and again 
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting 
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school 
Today I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate as well as members of my Cabinet  to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America depleted infrastructure 
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of AfricanAmericans to our nation our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all Proclamation 
Negotiations on DACA have begun Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal Wouldn it be great if we could finally after so many years solve the DACA puzzle This will be our last chance there will never be another opportunity March 5th 
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except of course the Democrats After many years we have taken care of our Military now we have to fix our roads bridges tunnels airports and more Bipartisan make deal Dems 
The journey to began 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year See you at

This will be a big week for Infrastructure After so stupidly spending 7 trillion in the Middle East it is now time to start investing in OUR Country 
Just spoke to to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from This is a true tragedy 
Rep Lou Barletta a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters will make a FANTASTIC Senator He is strong smart loves Pennsylvania loves our Country Voted for Tax Cuts unlike Bob Casey who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer 
42 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus andor Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut Jobs Billand it will only get better We are far ahead of schedule 
So many positive things going on for the USA and the Fake News Media just doesn want to go there Same negative stories over and over again No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history 
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe modern and lawful immigration system fully securing the border ending chain migration and canceling the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans 
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers their families and everybody at the 
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do The Dems had all three branches of government back in 20082011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA They only want to use it as a campaign issue Vote Republican 
agencies not just the FBI DOJ now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election Comey had conversations with Donald Trump which I don believe were accuratehe leaked information corrupt Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on 
My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the ClintonDNC Dossier it shows that he been victimized He been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of 
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation Some are true and some are false Some are old and some are new There is no recovery for someone falsely accused  life and career are gone Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process 
According to the a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the US Asking price was 10 million brought down to 1 million to be paid over time I hope people are now seeing understanding what is going on here It is all now starting to come out  DRAIN THE SWAMP 
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods and more would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency Told them to redo and send back in proper form 
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low 
Costs on nonmilitary lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election and beyond This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military but much waste in order to get Dem votes Fortunately DACA not included in this Bill negotiations to start now 
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election 
Just signed Bill Our Military will now be stronger than ever before We love and need our Military and gave them everything  and more First time this has happened in a long time Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS 
Wow Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch Warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting in London he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame All tied into Crooked Hillary 
Time to end the visa lottery Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans 
As long as we open our eyes to God grace  and open our hearts to God love  then America will forever be the land of the free the home of the brave and a light unto all nations 
I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 145pm Will be discussing North Korea China and the Middle East

Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington Great religious and political leaders and many friends including TV producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph will be there Looking forward to seeing all 
The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill 
Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration 
Best wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION

Congratulations and on the successful launch This achievement along with commercial and international partners continues to show American ingenuity at its best 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America Ronald Reagan 
Today we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS13 and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it Watch here 
We need a 21st century MERITBASED immigration system Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security 
Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA fully secures the border ends chain migration cancels the visa lottery If D oppose this deal they aren serious about DACAthey just want open borders 
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken 
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed linebacker Edwin Jackson This is just one of many such preventable tragedies We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST 
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law your paychecks are going way UP your taxes are going way DOWN and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS 
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure 
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA Make a deal 
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information Must be stopped 
Thank you to for exposing the truth Perhaps that why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition 
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and nonpersonal medical care No thanks 
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory 
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they done 
a tool of antiTrump political actors This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the lawThe FBI wasn straight with Congress as it hid most of these facts from investigators Wall Street Journal 
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermathThe FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossierthe FBI became 
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages and nobody even talks about them Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion 
This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead This is an American disgrace 
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49 a far better number than I had in winning the Election and higher than certain sacred cows Other Trump polls are way up also So why does the media refuse to write this Oh well someday 
Today it was my honor to join the great men and women of and at the US Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling Virginia Fact sheet

With 35 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS 2018 is off to great startUnemployment rate at 41Average earnings up 29 in the last year200000 new American jobs 
You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on the Trump Team Tom Fitton JW 
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans  something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago Rank File are great people 
The Democrats just aren calling about DACA Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they disappoint you again We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems March 5th is coming up fast

Democrats are not interested in Border Safety Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military They are only interested in Obstruction 
I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons 1 Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem 2 To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51 Nuclear Option and vote on real long term budget no CR 
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration Can let that hap

This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present 
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead in order to power through mess 
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety Security on the very dangerous Southern Border Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy

House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight So important for our country  our Military needs it 
AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big dreams bigger and always reaches for the stars YOU are the ones who will shape America destiny YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Departing Pittsburgh now where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers and to show the world that AMERICA is back  and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before 
A government shutdown will be devastating to our militarysomething the Dems care very little about 
CHIP should be part of a long term solution not a 30 Day or short term extension 
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world If there is no Wall there is no Deal 
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE running for Congress in a Special Election March 13 Rick is a great guy We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda 
The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous 71 billion dollar trade surplus with the US The 20 billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the US NAFTA is a bad joke 
The Wall is the Wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it Parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water 
ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more Together there is nothing we can overcomeeven a very biased media We ARE Making America Great Again

Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled Thank you and it will get even much better 
90 of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative and much of it contrived 
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead except as it pertains to the Dems Public gets it 
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now No more dangerous Lottery 
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country

Statement by me last night in Florida Honestly I don think the Democrats want to make a deal They talk about DACA but they don want to helpWe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don want to They don want security at the border they don want 
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible among many other things President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama and reversed our economic decline Thank you Stuart Varney 
President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers Most explosive Stock Market rally that we seen in modern times 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth All Trump not 0 
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT No more Lotteries FIRST 
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military 
So much Fake News is being reported They don even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They prom
and they knew exactly what I said and meant They just wanted a story FAKE NEWS 
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un of N Korea Obviously I didn say that I said I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un a big difference Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters 
Fusion GPS firm behind disputed Russia dossier retracts its claim of FBI mole in Trump camp

So much Fake News is being reported They don even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election 
I don believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA They are all talk and no action This is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have Too bad 
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market Chrysler coming back to US Michigan from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED It was headed for disaster 
AMERICA FIRST 
The Democrats are all talk and no action They are doing nothing to fix DACA Great opportunity missed Too bad 
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market Jobs are coming back to America Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing American business is hot again 
Today it was my great honor to proclaim January 15 2018 as Martin Luther King Jr Federal Holiday I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of Dr King life and legacy 
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country Never said take them out Made up by Dems I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians Probably should record future meetings  unfortunately no trust 
Sadly Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for DACA Take care of our Military and our Country FIRST 
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made  a big setback for DACA 
Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety DACA has now taken a big step backwards The Dems will threaten shutdown but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most Get smart MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
countries which are doing badly I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level I want safety and security for our people I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund 
The socalled bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards Wall was not properly funded Chain Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime 
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts only to build a new one in an off location for 12 billion dollars Bad deal Wanted me to cut ribbonNO 
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery Chain USA 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold  a first 
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for TrumpPence Plenty of more to follow 
More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than 1 BILLION in Michigan plant relocating their heavytruck production from Mexico to Michigan adding 2500 new jobs and paying 2000 bonus to US employees

Great news as a result of our TAX CUTS JOBS ACT 
With that being said I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land We need it Get smart 
45 year low in illegal immigration this year 
House votes on controversial FISA ACT today This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others 
In new Quinnipiac Poll 66 of people feel the economy is Excellent or Good That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll 
Disproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers Where are Crooked Hillary Emails What a mess 
Good news Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV a year and employ 4000 people Companies are coming back to the US in a very big way Congratulations Alabama 
Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4000 JOBS and investing 16 BILLION in Alabama helping to further grow our economy 
The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval The safety and security of our country is 
Today it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the  a great friend and ally of the United States Joint press conference 
I want to thank my for working tirelessly on behalf of our country 2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead Together we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion yet on and on it goes Russia the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing Republicans should finally take control 
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between TrumpRussia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace Must have tough Primary 
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case such as DACA always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts 
HSI agents and ERO officers on behalf of an entire Nation THANK YOU for what you are doing 247365 to keep fellow American SAFE Everyone is so grateful
Thank you Kevin McCarthy Couldn agree wyou more TOGETHER we are 
As I made very clear today our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border which must be part of any DACA approval 
Utilities cutting rates cite benefits of Trump tax reform

As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter I want to wish all of my friends supporters enemies haters and even the very dishonest Fake News Media a Happy and Healthy New Year 2018 will be a great year for America 
Iran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate Not good 
What a year it been and we just getting started Together we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Happy New Year 
My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County and their families We love our police and law enforcement  God Bless them all 
Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election People are much better off now not to mention ISIS VA Judges Strong Border 2nd A Tax Cuts more 
If the Dems Crooked Hillary got elected your stocks would be down 50 from values on Election Day Now they have a great future  and just beginning 
Big protests in Iran The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism Looks like they will not take it any longer The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations 
Trump Rally Stocks put 2017 in the record books 
Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the US Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better MUCH MORE TO COME 
I use Social Media not because I like to but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair press now often referred to as Fake News Media Phony and nonexistent sources are being used more often than ever Many stories reports a pure fiction 
On Taxes This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years agoThis is a huge progrowth stimulus for the economy Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow Now real economics and jobs Report 
Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice The world is watching 
The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and other than the vast military power of the United States that Iran people are what their leaders fear the most 
Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime corruption its squandering of the nation wealth to fund terrorism abroad Iranian govt should respect their people rights including right to express themselves The world is watching 
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc We must protect our Country at all cost 
Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer Should be charging MUCH MORE

While the Fake News loves to talk about my socalled low approval rating just showed that my rating on Dec 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec 28 2009 which was 47and this despite massive negative Trump coverage Russia hoax 
In the East it could be the COLDEST New Year Eve on record Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against Bundle up

Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good All are working hard In the meantime the Stock Market hit another record high

If last night election proved anything it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate 
Wow more than 90 of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke 
The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange and his numbers went up mightily is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election I was right Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him

Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and would do anything for them is now in the ring fighting against Trump Very disloyal to Bill CrookedUSED 
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia  so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don know andor have never met FAKE NEWS 
Another false story this time in the Failing that I watch 48 hours of television a day  Wrong Also I seldom if ever watch CNN or MSNBC both of which I consider Fake News I never watch Don Lemon who I once called the dumbest man on television Bad Reporting 
Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media They are out of control  correct reporting means nothing to them Major lies written then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposeda stain on America 
Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill Shaping up even better than projected House and Senate working very hard and smart End result will be not only important but SPECIAL 
Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA Really good news and much more to come 
No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans  not for criminal aliens

CNNS slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS

Report ANTITRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE Now it all starts to make sense 
People who lost money when the Stock Market went down 350 points based on the False and Dishonest reporting of Brian Ross of News he has been suspended should consider hiring a lawyer and suing ABC for the damages this bad reporting has caused  many millions of dollars 
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters  worst in History But fear not we will bring it back to greatness

Congratulations to News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia Russia Russia Witch Hunt More Networks and papers should do the same with their Fake News 
Many people in our Country are asking what the Justice Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress deleted and acid washed 33000 Emails No justice 
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday interrogation with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her Rigged system or just a double standard 
Great job First Lady Melania 
62 years ago this week a brave seamstress in Montgomery Alabama uttered one word that changed history 
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI He has pled guilty to those lies It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful There was nothing to hide

ALABAMA get out and vote for Luther Strange  he has proven to me that he will never let you down

But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team they ALL stood up for our National Anthem Big progress being made  we love our country 
The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard Great anger 
Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected 
Big election tomorrow in the Great State of Alabama Vote for Senator Luther Strange tough on crime border  will never let you down 
A few of the many clips of John McCain talking about Repealing Replacing OCare My oh my has he changedcomplete turn from years of talk 
owed to Wall Street and the banks which sadly must be dealt with Food water and medical are top priorities  and doing well 
It old electrical grid which was in terrible shape was devastated Much of the Island was destroyed with billions of dollars 
Texas Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico which was already suffering from broken infrastructure massive debt is in deep trouble 
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country 
General John Kelly totally agrees w my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY 
is Just reported COS John Kelly was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG ANTHEM COUNTRY Total lie
NFLplayer PatTillman joined US Army in 2002 He was killed in action 2004 He fought 4our countryfreedom
The White House never looked more beautiful than it did returning last night Important meetings taking place today Big tax cuts reform 
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem NFL must respect this 
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday which was a small percentage of total These are fans who demand respect for our Flag 
So proud of NASCAR and its supporters and fans They won put up with disrespecting our Country or our Flag  they said it loud and clear 
Making America Safe is my number one priority We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet 
Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country NFL should change policy 
Alaska Arizona Maine and Kentucky are big winners in the Healthcare proposal 7 years of Repeal Replace and some Senators not there 
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag  we MUST honor and respect it MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our
You can boycott our anthem WE CAN BOYCOTT YOU
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony Great team 
Great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country Standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable Bad ratings 
NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country League should back US 
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag Country you will see change take place fast Fire or suspend 
Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man they won be around much longer 
Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our countryTell them to stand 
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a moment of courage Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived 116 increase 
Iran just testfired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching IsraelThey are also working with North KoreaNot much of an agreement we have 
Very proud of our incredible First Lady  She is a truly great representative for our country 
our Great American Flag or Country and should stand for the National Anthem If not YOURE FIRED Find something else to do 
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect 
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship teamStephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn

Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do Better control management Great for Arizona McCain let his best friend LG down 
Arizona had a 116 increase in ObamaCare premiums last year with deductibles very high Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods Sad 
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves He campaigned on Repeal Replace Let Arizona down

Interview with on Fox Network  400 PM prior to Super Bowl Enjoy 
Why aren the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision 
Because the ban was lifted by a judge many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country A terrible decision 
What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone even with bad intentions can come into US 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election the FAKE NEWS is still lost 
The opinion of this socalled judge which essentially takes lawenforcement away from our country is ridiculous and will be overturned 
Interesting that certain MiddleEastern countries agree with the ban They know if certain people are allowed in it death destruction 
When a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in out especially for reasons of safety ampsecurity  big trouble 
Countries charge US companies taxes or tariffs while the US charges them nothing or littleWe should charge them SAME as they charge us 
We must keep evil out of our country

The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain Lindsey Graham is wrong  they are sadly weak on immigration The two 
Christians in the MiddleEast have been executed in large numbers We cannot allow this horror to continue 
Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting NOW Look what is happening all over Europe and indeed the world  a horrible mess

Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed

I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss 
I would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote  but would campaign differently 
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult sophisticated than the popular vote Hillary focused on the wrong states 
Yes it is true  Carlos Slim the great businessman from Mexico called me about getting together for a meeting We met HE IS A GREAT GUY 
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states  and more They focused on wrong states

I thought that would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however since election they are worse 
The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory  306 
is so embarrassed by their total 100 support of Hillary Clinton and yet her loss in a landslide that they don know what to do
There is NO QUESTION THAT did take place and in favor of

Just met with General Petraeuswas very impressed 
If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people the CubanAmerican people and the US as a whole I will terminate deal 
Serious voter fraud in Virginia New Hampshire and California  so why isn the media reporting on this Serious bias  big problem 
states instead of the 15 states that I visited I would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten 
It would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 
In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally 
Trump is going to be our President We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead So much time and money will be spent  same result Sad 
this election That is a direct threat to our democracy She then said We have to accept the results and look to the future Donald  
of position Then separately she stated He said something truly horrifying  he refused to say that he would respect the results of  
during a general election I for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind  
and fair elections We accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a  
Hillary debate answer on delay That is horrifying That is not the way our democracy works Been around for 240 years We had free  
Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in Nothing will change 
The Democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted Not so anymore

Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions I am the only one who knows who the finalists are 
The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play Campaigning is much different 
If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in NY Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily 
The debates especially the second and third plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS gave us the win

Stay on message is the chant I always do  trade jobs military vets 2nd A repeal Ocare borders etc  but media misrepresents 
I have always been the same personremain true to selfThe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so 
It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false 
I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process People get it 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media She is not a talented person or politician The dishonest media refuses to expose 
My rallies are not covered properly by the media They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm 
If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn put false meaning into the words I say I would be beating Hillary by 20 
The failing which never spoke to me keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change False I am who I amnever said 
The failing talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened Their reporting is fiction The media protects Hillary 
You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people Loves U Thanks

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President 
The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva Switzerland not the plane carrying 400 million in cash going to Iran 
President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding I won dodge questions as your President 
Obama disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression 
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillarythat really saying something 
The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs or headline fundraisers  those disconnected from real life 
Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding  or are they worried it will hurt Hillary 
When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary payforplay at State Department 
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs 
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton 
Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno Nevada tonight at 7pm Tickets available at 
So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine they have already taken Crimea and continue to push That what I said 
When I said in an interview that Putin is not going into Ukraine you can mark it down I am saying if I am President Already in Crimea 
This story is not about Mr Khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the US Get smart 
Mr Khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over TV doing the same  Nice 
Wow it is unbelievable how distorted onesided and biased the media is against us The failing is a joke is laughable 
Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media HillaryClinton wouldn stand a chance and her only hope
The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention I wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H 
I was viciously attacked by Mr Khan at the Democratic Convention Am I not allowed to respond Hillary voted for the Iraq war not me 
Captain Khan killed 12 years ago was a hero but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it 
We crushed the original goal I will write a 2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our endofmonth goal 
Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH TRUMP 322 MILLION CLINTON 278 MILLION Thank you

NATO commander agrees members should pay up via 
Wow NATO top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS This is a general I will like 
The Rust Belt was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico END 
Crooked stop in Johnstown Pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than 200  with Bill VP 
Obama third term which would be terrible news for our economic growth  seen below
Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA 
I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better 
Why doesn the media want to report that on the two Big Thursdays when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches  Republican won ratings 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes A formula for disaster 
Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities 
I will write a 2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our milliondollar endofmonth goal

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton 
I am watching Crooked Hillary speak Same old stuff our country needs change 
Wow my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary She sold them out VP pick 
In Hillary Clinton America  things get worse 
The dishonest media didn mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked speech He wishes he didn make that deal 
Thank you Facebook 
Crooked Hillary said that I couldn handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign ReallyI just beat 16 people and am beating her 
If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York he wouldn get 10 of the vote  they would run him out of town 
Little Michael Bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me His last term as Mayor was a disaster 
General John Allen who I never met but spoke against me last night failed badly in his fight against ISIS His record  BAD 
Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech Many of her statements were lies and fabrications 
Join at the University of Northwestern Ohio tonight at 7pm Tickets 
I believe in science Dem code for we shutting down coal mines steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing
CAMPAIGN STATEMENT 
Two policemen just shot in San Diego one dead It is only getting worse People want LAW AND ORDER 
Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream 
The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke and the little watched  SAD 
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton  corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes 
Hillary wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world 
Hillary vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety 
Hillary will never reform Wall Street She is owned by Wall Street 
Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words 
Hillary refusal to mention Radical Islam as she pushes a 550 increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country 
I will once again write a 1 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our milliondollar endofmonth goal 
Departing now  thank you Cedar Rapids Iowa This is a MOVEMENT

Join our next Vice President in Wisconsin tonight Michigan ThursdayMI 
Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complainingthen a small one Pathetic 
Our not very bright Vice President Joe Biden just stated that I wanted to carpet bomb the enemy Sorry Joe that was Ted Cruz 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about The danger is massive NO 
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally Get tough 
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country No recognition  SAD 
Funny how the failing is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said Trump is a genius America 1st 
As I have been saying Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv 
Just like I have warned from the beginning Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP 
Many of Bernie supporters have left the arena Did Bernie go home and go to sleep 
I hate to say it but the Republican Convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the Democratic Convention 
No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible Highly overrated 
You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is and neither does ISIS a good thing Please get your facts straight  thanks 
I with you I will work hard and never let you down Make America Great Again 
I with you I will work hard and never let you down Make America Great Again 
I with you I will work hard and never let you down Make America Great Again 
For the record I have ZERO investments in Russia 
In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump Crazy 
Dems don want to talk ISIS bc Hillary foreign interventions unleashed ISIS her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here 
Bernie exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed 
The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar 
Thank you New Hampshire 
Join us in Toledo Ohio tomorrow night at 8pm 
Join us tomorrow in Scranton Pennsylvania at 3pm Tickets 
Pocahontas bombed last night Sad to watch 
Why aren the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order The Republican Convention was great 
Funny if you listen to the Democrats did not have a good day If you listen to the other two they are fawning What a difference 
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton All of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it Waste of time 
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated 
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs 
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future I know more about Cory than he knows about himself 
I was at and met Juan Williams in passing He asked if he could have pictures taken with me I said fine He then trashes on air 
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money The VP a joke 
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers 
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters Kaine supports TPP is in pocket of Wall Street and backed Iraq War 
Thank you OHIO 
Thank you Roanoke Virginia be back soon 
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN 
Great POLL numbers are coming out all over People don want another four years of Obama and Crooked Hillary would be even worse 
The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE 
Wow the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess But fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn 
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the DNC  they just got caught that all They laughed at Bernie 
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same 
Thank you 
Hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened 
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against Bernie 
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails which should never have been written stupid because Putin likes me 
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes No way they are going to fix America problems ISIS all others laughing 
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great Thank you 
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she out 
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing Emails say the rigged system is alive well 
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook 
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS Too bad Bernie flamed out 
If the Republican Convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player Bernie media would go wild 
The panels are so one sided almost all against Trump is so much better and the ratings are much higher Don watch CNN 
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left 
Today proves what I have always known that Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz  
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can go on any longer He is trying to dismiss the new emails and DNC disrespect SAD 
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders political revolution He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end 
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates 
Looks like the Bernie people will fight If not their BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time Kaine stands for opposite 
Wow President Obama brother Malik just announced that he is voting for me Was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else 
Bernie Sanders started off strong but with the selection of Kaine for VP is ending really weak So much for a movement TOTAL DISRESPECT 
The Crooked Hillary VP choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H 
Dinesh DSousa Hillary America see it
Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals
Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night From the heart 
The Wikileaks email release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud 
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together ISIS and our other enemies are drooling They don look presidential to me 
I will bring jobs back and get wages up People haven had a real wage increase in almost twenty years Clinton killed jobs 
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved Job killer 
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs I will bring jobs back 
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania Against steelworkers and miners Husband signed NAFTA 
Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders Mock his heritage and much more Online from Wikileakes really vicious RIGGED 
Pocahontas wanted VP slot so badly but wasn chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate Also Crooked Hillary hates her 
Tim Kaine is and always has been owned by the banks Bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice Bernie fought for nothing 
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for Philly fight 
General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS
I highly recommend the just out book  THE FIELD OF FIGHT  by General Michael Flynn How to defeat radical Islam 
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn get indicted while Bob M did 
Another attack this time in Germany Many killed God bless the people of Munich 
One of the best produced including the incredible stage set in the history of conventions Great unity Big TV ratings

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH 
The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania speech than the FBI spent on Hillary emails 
Good news is Melania speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press 
In November I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state Jobs 
Bill Hemmer of was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena More than in past years 
Congratulations to my children Don and Tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night I am very proud of you 
Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States I will work hard and never let you down AMERICA FIRST 
The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention Very exciting

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live 
I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton Check it out Sleepy Eyes 
Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd a man with so little touch for politics is at it againHe could not have watched my standing ovation speech in NC 
Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in AC Others to follow Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City 
Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves  Convention Center Airport  and destroyed City 
I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago great timing as all know Pols made big mistakes now many bankruptcies 
Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country She is sooooo guilty But watch her time will come 
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges but 
Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest incompetent and of very bad judgement 
Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information Not fit 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the US Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong BAD JUDGEMENT 
I don think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with murder Come November 8 she out 
Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning Lots of support Win 
I will be interviewed by tonight on at 11pm Enjoy 
My son will be interviewed by tonight at 10pm on Enjoy

With Hillary and Obama the terrorist attacks will only get worse Politically correct fools won even call it what it is  RADICAL ISLAM 
Crooked Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell but the system is totally rigged and corrupt Where are the 33000 missing emails 
The only people who are not interested in being the VP pick are the people who have not been asked 
I look forward to meeting today in New Jersey She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa 
Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday Very impressed great people 
Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday Despite a totally onesided interview by Chuck Todd the end result was solid 
Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff Star or plain star 
Happy 4th of July 
Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS  it will just go on forever We need change 
The third mass attack slaughter in days by ISIS 200 dead in Baghdad worst in many years We do not have leadership that can stop this 
In Bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran 20 were killed 
I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the USAG So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught 
The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the USAG in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting go away no pictures 
Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the USAG talked only about grandkids and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac 
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED 
On Saturday a great man Elie Wiesel passed awayThe world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil 
Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the USAG to work out a deal The system is totally rigged corrupt 
Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the USAG was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know 
Just watched and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd and the entire show is against meThe good newsthe people get it 
It was just announcedby sourcesthat no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton Like I said the system is totally rigged 
It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton What she did was wrong What Bill did was stupid 
Thank you 
Thank you for your support 
Reminder last year Clinton pledged she had turned over all workrelated email under penalty of perjury
Thank you 
If I become the next POTUS they will not be ignoring

I will be interviewed by tonight at 10pm on FOX Enjoy 
The reason I put up approximately 50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx 50 million loan I have totally terminated the loan 
The very dishonest refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my 50 million loan to my campaign Done deal 
One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn see how she got rich selling out America 
Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President She will destroy them

TERRORISM IMMIGRATION AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH TRANSCRIPT 
Congratulations to the 2016 Champions Pittsburgh

I will be going to New Hampshire today home of my first primary victory to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday 230 PM 
I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror Hillary just brokesaid she would now use 
What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning Our leadership is weak and ineffective I called it and asked for the ban Must be tough 
Please make us safe We cannot have Hillary as president We will be in so much trouble
Reporting that Orlando killer shouted Allah hu Akbar as he slaughtered clubgoers 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade 
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism If he doesn he should immediately resign in disgrace 
Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism I don want congrats I want toughness vigilance We must be smart 
Horrific incident in FL Praying for all the victims their families When will this stop When will we get tough smart vigilant 
Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story I would NEVER mock disabled Shame

In politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in US history 
The writer of the now proven false story in the Michael Barbaro who was interviewed on CBS this morning was unable to respond 
Over 50 women were interviewed by the yet they only wrote about 6 That because there were so many positive statements

The failing is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage See mediaasking for increase 
Our Native American Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren couldn care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman card like her friend crooked Hillary See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you

Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson says he back Trump for president via

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective Does nothing All talk no action  maybe her Native American name 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant She is too easy I driving her nuts 
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me 
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy 
Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie She is not Native American 
Let properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren records to see if she is Native American I say she a fraud 
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate I will defeat them both

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him Typical politician  can make a deal work 
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses 
Lyin Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one Shows weakness 
Lyin Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate Their donors special interest groups are not happy with them Sad 
Wow just announced that Lyin Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination DESPERATION 
I am happy to hear how badly the is doing It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down Becoming irrelevant

Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter 
Thank you 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference What is in her hand 
This was the reporters statement when she found out there was tape from my facility she changed her tune 
Victory press conference was over Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions Can I press charges 
Why aren people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened that is before she found out the episode was on tape 
Wow Corey Lewandowski my campaign manager and a very decent man was just charged with assaulting a reporter Look at tapesnothing there 
How come the show the new Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz 
I have millions more voteshundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC 
Wow has nothing but my opponents on their shows Really onesided and unfair reporting Maybe I shouldn do their townhall tonight 
We need to secure our borders ASAP No games we must be smart tough and vigilant MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN 
Lyin Ted I have already beaten you in all debates and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates You should focus on jobs illegal imm 
LyinTed Cruz is weak losing big so now he wants to debate again But according to DrudgeTime and online polls I have won all debates 
After the way I beat Gov Scott Walker and Jeb Rand Marco and all others in the Presidential Primaries no way he would ever endorse me 
Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say If you for Motherhood he be against it
Just released that international gangs are all over our cities This will end when I am President 
Campaigntodate popular GOP totals 7546980 5481737 2724749 A BIG DIFFERENCE
Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism as well as current mission but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE a must

The United States cannot continue to make such bad onesided trade deals There are only so many jobs we can give up No more 
See Lyin Ted even the no fan of mine says this story came from Rubio not Trump 
Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than CruzLawsuit coming 
Why can the pundits be honest Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again I will make it strong and great JOBS 
Another radical Islamic attack this time in Pakistan targeting Christian women children At least 67 dead400 injured I alone can solve 
Happy Easter to all have a great day 
My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive and unfair for the US are now finally receiving plaudits 
Wow sleepy eyes is at it again He is do totally biased The things I am saying are correct  far better vision than the others 
I am interviewed on This Week on this morning Enjoy 
Remember I am the only candidate who is selffunding While I am given little credit for this by the voters I am not bought like others 
Don believe the Polls they are just another phony hit job on me I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election 
Wisconsin economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in US jobs are leaving I will make our economy strong again  bring in jobs 
Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J Trump Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong Illegals out 
Lyin Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enqwere caused by me I had NOTHING to do with story 
The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite 
The media is so after me on women Wow this is a tough business Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump 
WOMEN LOVE TRUMP TRUMPS EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE
Dear after doing a quick Google Twitter search there are over 15000 women groups supporting DonaldTrump Stop Lying
Let me help you Trumpophobes with math Trump 103B12M 74 equity12M  858233 SampP 13145
Turns out was wrong had nothing to do with it
Your instincts on foreign policy terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined
Top suspect in Paris massacre Salah Abdeslam who also knew of the Brussels attack is no longer talking Weak leaders ridiculous laws 
blames for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis
Wow just released that 67 million in negative ads was spent on me How am I still number one  by a lot 
I didn start the fight with LyinTed Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania he did He knew the PAC was putting it out  hence Lyin Ted 
Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it If I lostmonster story 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Endorsements for Lyin Ted Cruz 
Cruz Rubio are scared WATCH gt
Europe and the US must immediately stop taking in people from Syria This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it So sad 
Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe Also many in US I TOLD YOU SO I alone can fix this problem 
They all braindead puppets with skeletons in their closet I say you go on and destroy them all A dead show
Explain how the women on The View which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left ever got their jobs is wasting time 
TV show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on I TELL THEM NO
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years TIME FOR A CHANGE I WILL SOLVE  AND FAST 
Talkers think about the future Doers are already building it
It is amazing how often I am right only to be criticized by the media Illegal immigration take the oil build the wall Muslims NATO 
Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing wrote a critical article I was so right 
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better 
and Lyin Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike  ALL TALK AND NO ACTION Both talk about ISIS do nothing
It is amazing how gets on so many TV shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly ZERO in his pres run 
thank God is not a politician but he one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of NATO Why It is time to renegotiate and the time is now 
NATO is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on 
A picture is worth a thousand words
Donald Trump will be greater president than Ragan Trump will set the button for moralityChristianity
selffunded and media loves him Not beholden to masters like Who owns Ted
You have over 2M followers more than than This says something about how America feels
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
I want to thank for all of his help in our historic Arizona win Could not have done it without you Joe 
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race 
I think having Jeb endorsement hurts Lyin Ted Jeb spent more than 150000000 and got nothing I spent a fraction of that and am first 
I will be the best by far in fighting terror I the only one that was right from the beginning now Lyin Ted others are copying me 
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror She been in office fighting terror for 20 years and look where we are 
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates Lyin Ted Cruz Honestly I can blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion

Signing a recent tax return isn this ridiculous 
Just for your info tax returns have 0 to do w someone net worth I have already filed my financial statements w FEC They are great 
Why doesn just endorse alreadyShould have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway Too latenow 
Mitt Romney who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics is now pushing me on tax returns Dope 
Great new poll Thank you Texas 
hates to see Trump success when he was so pathetic
Romney is a pawn of the Establishment and has no individual thought process He is jealous of Trump
Romney should have been a tough guy with Obama He cowered and lost BADLY He not relevant
Love it is done We need someone who is proven will make America Great Again
Trump is so impressive and no other politician has his passion energy to
A vote for or is a vote for corruption special interests and lobbyists Trump for POTUS
Mr Tough Guy Romney should be backing Trump like Trump backed him last time
Ted Cruz is lying again Polls are showing that I do beat Hillary Clinton head to head Check out Poll snd Q Poll 
Texas Georgia many more VOTE EARLY This is a movement VOTE VIDEO 
That why we are angry The Republican Establishment will not support you You are who the American people want
This Texan will be voting Trump March 1st Cruz is a fake Texan
Chris thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement I will not let you down
When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear I will get most of his votes  no problem 
Why would Texans vote for liar Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada lived there for 4 yearsand remained a Canadian citizen until recently 
When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win 
Oh great is doing a on like losing the presidency wasn enough He a fool
Mitt Romneywho totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool is now playing tough guy 
The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters That is how I got to 46 When others drop out I will pick up more Sad but true

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz  totally false more dirty tricks He got caught in so many lies  is this man crazy 
Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks No wonder he has lost Evangelical support 
Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false  no basis in fact Take ad down Ted Biggest liar in politics 
Wow Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director More dirty tricks 
It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done 
Thank you for your endorsement Video

Taking a helicopter to New Hampshire boarding now Amazing activity planned New UMASS poll very nice 
Politicians are trying to chip away at the 2nd Amendment I won let them take away our guns 
This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at minimum 
as per the show an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone
discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa as they went to vote
Thank you Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa with each candidate moving up one notch 
Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn want to run against me He would be so easy to beat 
THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock Arkansas tonight A record crowd of 12K 
CONSTRUCTIVE WINS
Stop the assault on American values Stand w Trump to 
Thank you New Hampshire 
Dr Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies 
Cruz just lied again I am and have been totally against repeal and replace 
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud 
This was sent out from Ted Cruz as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote 
I will be interviewed on at 700 PM Enjoy 
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified 
And finally Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice  a total lie 
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of F and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz Fraud 
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud Also Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters 
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus Cruz put out a release that was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for Cruz 
Ted Cruz didn win Iowa he stole it That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated Bad 
Great job on tonight begged us for a job We said no and she went hostile A real dummy 
On my way to New Hampshire expecting a big and spirited crowd 
Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment 
All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history And he never held office
Iowa is meaninglesskeep pushing forward run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday America needs you
a real leader that truly cares about America our values He wants to bring prosperity back 2 USA
Amazing job in Iowa Cruz just barely won
if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states Momentum is growing
Remarkable how costeffective Post says Trump campaign was per vote and stunning how much Jeb spent per vote
You MUST win the Presidency in 2016

Is Cruz honest He is in bed w Wall St is funded by Goldman SachsCiti low interest loans No legal disclosure never sold off assets 
Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator only when he started to run for He could be Canadian Prime Minister 
Cruz says I supported TARP which gave 25 million to Goldman Sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didn disclose Puppet 
The only reason irrelevant doesn like me is I refused to do his failing show  asked many times Very few listeners  sad 
one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog Why doesn he say that

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about demeaning 
Wow Ted Cruz received 487K in campaign contributions 11M from a NY hedge fund mogul 1M low int loan from Goldman Sachs Hypocrite 
Departing NH now great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth in a snow storm Thank you 
Greatly dishonest of to file a financial disclosure form not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St 
When will give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him 
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics 
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage 
Ted is the ultimate hypocrite Says one thing for money does another for votes 
Great new numbers Thank you 
Ted Cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks They own him 
Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a natural born Canadian did he borrow unreported loans from C banks 
Oh no just reported that Ted Cruz didn report another loan this one from Citi Wow no wonder banks do so well in the US Senate 
The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace Remember his wife employer and his lender is located there 
Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file Goldman Sachs owns him he will do anything they demand Not much of a reformer 
Ted Cruz said he didn know that he was a Canadian Citizen He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million  loan papersNot believable 
Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow I told you so 
More radical Islam attacks today  it never ends Strengthen the borders we must be vigilant and smart No more being politically correct 
is a total clown Has zero credibility

Heading to Biloxi Mississippi Massive crowds expected Thank you for your support 
Remember I am selffunding my campaign the only one in either party I not controlled by lobbyists or special interestsonly the USA 
When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware  the candidates are mere puppets  
I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women 
Hillary Clinton doesn have the strength or stamina to be president Jeb Bush is a low energy individual but Hillary is not much better 
Hillary Clinton said that it is OK to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL but not OK to do so in the US We must be vigilant 
is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls Has no chance
is a sad case A total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads
Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night Look forward to it 2015 IN PHOTOS

Great poll thank you Nevada

Thank you Hilton Head South Carolina 
Thank you Hilton Head South Carolina 
I never thought I be saying this but I really enjoyed on television lately and he was terrific hosting 
Joe McQuaid  is desperately trying to sell the It a loser and my comments haven helped him much 
The dying newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them like a bully that got knocked out 
Good morning Mr Trump You so AWESOME
WOW FANTASTIC WHO KNEW AMERICANS WERE SO SMART GREAT TO KNOW WERE so smart
DonaldTrump  How do u do it Donald No one could keep up with u at your pace Shows how hard u will work for us as President
Keep the momentum going Mr Trump All the best to you for the New Year Make America Great Again  Thanks
what do you think of Jeb cancelling his Iowa rally last night  I went he didn
Iowa was fantastic last night amazing crowd and people I now in Florida getting ready to go to South Carolina Big crowd very exciting 
You were great on last night Thanks for the nice words MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
THANK YOU Council Bluffs Iowa The silent majority is silent no more 
Joe McQuaid  of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweetsvery unethical 
The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper 
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid  of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn do his failed debate 
I hope does better for Rubio than he did at the hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans America 
We need a real President 
Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs Iowa later today Despite weather rally is on  will be fantastic 
So I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place Jeb Bush has spent 59 million done Run country my way 
My campaign for president is 35000000 under budget I have spent very little and am in 1st placeNow I will spend big in IowaNHSC 
Minorities line up behindDonald Trump 
is terrific at hosting on  he really gets it
Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008 He was terrible failed badly and was called a racist 
Trump listening to voters unlike GOP
No casualties Just victory victory and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart We love God and USA
Why do u keep trying to attack Trump Really dumb strategy U lose he wins make America great again
FLASHBACK1986 Saved a Georgia Farm Thank you nice memories
Thank you Nashua New Hampshire 
Thank you 
Thank you to a supporter for this video of my campaign over the past 6 months Video 
Strange but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I lowering taxes while he will double triple them a disaster 
Wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few and people have lost faith in our leadersWe need smart and strong leadership now 
Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries We now are part time sad I WILL FIX 
The middleclass has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of  and no effective raise in years BAD 
If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the women card on me she wrong 
We need a real President to get things done and that why we want you Thank you
Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia Republican Party FAST 
Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late Stupid RNC 
blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her email crime said that I feel wages in America are too high Lie
The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory The Dems LOVE IT Be smart and win for a change 
RPVirginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row Will now not allow desperately needed new voters Suicidal mistake RNC MUST ACT NOW 
It begins Republican Party of Virginia controlled by the RNC is working hard to disallow independent unaffiliated and new voters BAD 
He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him
My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy
Face it Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi He allowed it to drag out and in the end let Hillary get away with murder
andreajmarkley Rubio finally gets an endorsement  from loser Gowdy via dailyne
I will do far more for women than Hillary and I will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to dono strengthstamina 
Thank you 
Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HES DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM so inappropriate 
If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the  of uninsured is still largeObamacare is a failure since so expensive
A new terror warning was issued for European cties At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart Weak leaders 
Story
Criminal deportations in the US are the lowest number in many years We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country MUST CHANGE 
The Phoenix VA it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before The wait is horrendous and people are dying I will fix it 
The same people that said I wouldn run or that I wouldn lead or do well 1st place and leading by 21 now say I won beat Hillary 
is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until I came alongno ratings I will beat Hillary
just announced that TRUMP was story of 2015 Totally meaningless however if we don WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again
Thank u Mr Trump I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States So nice
You know what making my Christmas Great FamilyfoodfriendsampYOU I HAVE MY TRUMP SHION WHOPE IN MY HEAfor America
Thank you for your tweet today on Christmas Can wait to see you as President Mr Trump You are awesome
I reading Best book ever Thank you
When will the Democrats and Hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and Mexico is going to pay for it Never 
Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the VA That will stop I will fix this quickly 
Remember when failed candidate said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE He spent 59 million and is at 3 
We have many problems in our house country and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally Politics 
was GREAT today on She gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly Have her on more
Merry Christmas to all Have a great day and have a really amazing year Together we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN It will be done 
Great job on today Very wise indeed
Why didn you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video Bad reporting Perhaps will do better next yearbut doubt it
should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story True a total distortion of the facts
I am now in Palm Beach Florida and will be going to church tonight MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
and very dishonest in not showing the new Poll where I am at 39 21points higher than Cruz Be honest Chuck
Why isn using the much newer Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll CNN even better 
Wow because of the pressure put on by me ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS It about time 
Next year will be an interesting one I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly 
Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing are totally in the Hillary circle of bias Think about Bill 
Wow even lowly Rand Paul has just past in the new Poll Jeb is at 3 I at 39 Stop throwing your money down the drain 
In the ridiculous ad about me Jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesn allow my answer which destroys him  SO SAD 
Poor spent 50 million on his campaign I spent almost nothing He bottom and gone I top by a lot That what US needs 
Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACETrump is leading Cruz 39 to 18Big Detail
A great Christmas movie perfect Story 
why is Hillary even allowed to run She a criminal
why is Hillary even allowed to run She a criminal Good question
Hillary said I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign I deplore the death and destruction she causedstupidity 
Merry Christmas Happy Holidays 
Hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to I have great respect for women BE CAREFUL 
It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media New Poll amazing in ALL categories 21 pt Lead 
Why does give so much airtime He and other Fox pundits is so biased Still thinks Romney won Unfair coverage of Trump 
treats me so badly Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out Poll All negative
The which is the lobbyist power for not imposing taxes on today did a nasty cartoon attacking kids Bad 
The silent majority is silent no more Remember the importance of VOTING 
The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card 
Thank you America Together we will 
Big news just out  NEW POLL TRUMP 39 and leads in every major category Likeability way up CRUZ 18 CARSON 10 RUBIO 10 
We need a PRESIDENT with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again 
It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong Sad 
When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama it meant got beaten badly The media knows this Often used word in politics 
Wow new Reuters Poll just out Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN TRUMP 37 CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge 
For those on TV defending my use of the word schlonged bc is giving it false meaningtell them it means beaten badly Dishonest 
NPR said schlonged to WaPo re 1984 MondaleFerraro campaign That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls 
Once again is dishonest Schlonged is not vulgar When I said Hillary got schlonged that meant beaten badly 
Jeb big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesn have me answering Jeb statements He is really pathetic 
Watching and consider to be one of the least talented people on television Boring and biased 
Women defy media narrative love Trump at packed Michigan rallyVIDEO 
The Donald should been named Man of the Year He dominates the polls news talk shows social media MAGA
Well I at 42 and your at 3 You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage Classic
opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terriblefumbled around incoherent
Why doesn in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate 
Will in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate 
just took millions of  in special interest money to look like a tough guy Will never work
Weak and low energy whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy 
A GREAT PATRIOT
This suggests that online polls are more reliable so Trump is crushing both parties

Problem is I never watched you until Trump started giving you interviews and ratings on CNN
You the real deal For my money tedcruz just doesn cut the mustard Go Trump
TRUMP NEEDS HIS OWN POLL A REAL POLL IN EVERY STATE THESE POLLS ARE SO RIDICULOUSTHE MEDIA WILL ONLY GET WORSE FROM HERE
That why after your interview I couldn watch the panel discussion which is usually my favorite segment
Not so much fairness as it is about ratings  Megan Kellys hate nightly of Trump is turnoff for FOX
I was disappointed that Ted Cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it Well welcome to the wonderful world of politics 
I did interview with Chris Wallace of in order to be fair He then puts on Rove Lane and Will three Trump bashers to discuss 
Everyone vote for and no he did not pay me for this endorsement

A wonderful afternoon in Iowa Great people Heading now to Florida  tomorrow South Carolina 
A great evening in Iowa Thank you Des Moines Area Community College for a great forum 
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people lives A total failure 
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete total dud 
John Kasich fell right into President Obama trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it Shame 
Doesn help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  he almost last 
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easyhe came in dead last 
Kasich has already spent 6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down People from NH are smart 
Watch Kasich squirm  if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun 
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don want to waste my money 
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls Pathetic 
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me 
Governor Kasich whose failed campaign debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend 25 million against me

I will be interviewed by tonight at 1000 on  Much much much to talk about 
Melania and I just had interview with the legendary Watch this Friday Tonight we talk ISIS

One of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great They have lost their way and are no longer credible 
What is our President doing 
GOP Voters Trust Donald Trump to Keep Our Country Safe 
Refugees from Syria are now pouring into our great country Who knows who they are  some could be ISIS Is our president insane

Carly whose campaign is dead is making false statements about me in order to salvage hope Sad
had to inject herself into my factual statements concerning Ben Carson in order to breathe life into her failing campaign
I only said I was on four weeks ago with Putinnever said I was in Green Room Separate piecesgreat ratings
Ben Carson said in his own book that he has a pathological temper pathological disease I didn say it he did Apology
CarlyI did graduate from Wharton and did very well Who is your fact checker Will you apologize
Carly not just you I also told Gov Kasich to let Jeb talk give him a chance because Kasich was constantly cutting in

Wow pres candidate Ben Carson who is very weak on illegal Immigration just said he likes amnesty and a pathway to citizenship 
Total fool is part of the Republican Establishment problem An all talk no action dummy 
and dopey Karl Rove made a mistake and purposely mischaracterized my statement on the terrible TPP deal
Why does the failing write a false editorial about me and let dummy make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper 
is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re China and TPP This moron wasted 430 million on political campaigns and lost 100
We as a country either have borders or we don IF WE DONT HAVE BORDERS WE DONT HAVE A COUNTRY 
Why wouldn the call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong No wonder it is doing poorly 
When and how are the dummies at the going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect Editorial on me I want smart trade deals 
The Editorial Board is so wrong so often They got info from an incorrect story in another pub Why not watch and listen to debate 
Editorial Board should review my debate statement re China and TPP and apologize China not part but will get their way in later
Today Editorial is WRONG again I know that China is not in the new TPP trade deal but would come in latter through a back door 
I will be interviewed on at 730 
All seven online polls including Drudge and Time with thousands of respondents said I won the debate said I was so so 
I not convinced that any candidate other than is committed to securing our borders

I can wait to watch snl tomorrow A really big show
One of the dumbest political pundits on television is Chris Stirewalt of Wrong facts  check Fox debate rankings Trump Dope 
THIS IS WHY THE POLLS ARE WRONG I am a lifelong democrat And I will be voting trump
One more day Donald Trump hosts with tomorrow Will be a wild night
Would be nice if learned how to read the polls before writing his next story Probably done on purpose but not good reporting 
has become a sad case His magazine is failing badly probably doesn have long to go and his predictions are always wrong
don let the Keystone Pipeline die The US needs to be good neighbors with Canada and energy independent
Only Donald Trump can Thank you
Will be on tonight Signing a copy of Crippled America for Bill

Happy Birthday to the great He done so many wonderful things not the least of which is his fantastic family I love Billy 
IS CARSON HALLUCINATING NOW LIES ABOUT WESTPOINT
DonaldTrump has built a lifetime reputation of doing what he says he will do He keeps his promises
Will be highest rated show ever is a marketing genius Hope it does well
GREAT Video Which of these 4 Polls is Suspect Kudos to
Super excited to watch tomorrow night on
and they kept Rand Paul on the main stage Let get Huck and Christie back
The straw man candidate is falling apart
How anyone could see him as president baffles me Lies and insane theories
KEEP IT COMMING TRUMP People need to be warned about that Carson figure who is not who they think
Getting ready for commercial 
This is not good WOW one of many lies by Ben Carson Big story
All Rep should stand with Forget Bush Rubio and knife attackers
Thank you so much for the nice words and supportreally enjoy listening to your ideas and thoughts
I think it would be a good ideaand fairto include in the debate Both solid good guys 
Carson now admits his friend named Bob who he tried to stab Bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as Bob Wrong name 
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage  don people get it 
Such bad reporting A puff piece on Ben Carson in the states that Carson is trying to solidify his lead But I am easily Sad 
Florida Ethics Commission Advocate comes down hard on Rubio So do two people who worked with him Said he used the wrong credit card Sure 
Rubio is a Manchurian Candidate People will own him if he ever became president
lead in Reuters National poll
Marco Rubio can even handle his own credit card how is he going to be able to handle the US finances
it about time we find a republican that can take on the democrats
Interesting presidential race Carson tries to beat his mom with a hammer and beats Carson in the polls
Silent majority did not try to kill their mothers like Ben Carson but wants America rebuilt by only one capableTRUMP
A great honor to easily finish FIRST in the poll tabulation even though some of my best polls were not used in determining winner 
Wow You openly LIE about who ahead in the GOP race Trump is LEADING in 99 of polls Shameful
Ivanka said it and you said it too you be great for women
TRUMP Supporters aren Angry We Smart  We Men  Women  Millennials  Politically Saavy
I love to see the respect you have shown to your parents siblings and children Proven Respect and Class needed in USA
The Carson story is either a total fabrication or if true even worsetrying to hit mother over the head with a hammer or stabbing friend 
MSM are LYING to you about Hispanics hating Trump Here the real deal
Rubio lied about my meeting w Hispanic activists I didn change my opinion but treated them w respect Shame 
poll numbers are higher then most think no one is asking Democrats if they are voting Trump
I just finished reading Crippled America It a detailed blueprint to get America back on track
No need Everyone knows Jeb is full of blank
JEBS Whole campaign is fueled by lies Just like his brother lied about Iraq BUSH DYNASTYLIES
should have corrected Jeb Bush when he said that I ran for president twice Never ran merely considered running
I am a lifelong democrat And I will be voting trump Great
What other candidate begins to rival Trump in his knowledge breadth of issues stamina Thanks
Why didn correct Jeb when he said has run 4 president 2X B4Jeb needs 2B corrected bc he lied
Carson has the WORST health plan EVER re Soc Sec and Medicare He wants to abolish Medicare  no way
Jeb Bush just said about Marco Rubio he my friend Pure political speak Why can he be truthful and say disloyal guy no friend 
Also tune in to the at 700am I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and 
I will unveil my first campaign ads on at 630am tomorrow Enjoy 
Wow poll just came out with 26 Almost as importantly I am the strongest on economic issues by far

Join me Tuesday Nov 3rd at 12 PM in in NYC I be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA Don miss it 
If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered 
Marco Rubio will not win Weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight 
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor 
Jeb new slogan  Jeb can fix it I never thought of Jeb as a crook Stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics 
Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio READ THIS 
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer Mr Amnesty endorsementRubs can win 
Anyway for me the most original costume was Donald Trump like President
First Vote News Video  Mike Tyson Endorses Donald Trump for President  Thanks Mike
And you still a negative loser and Trump is still a positive winner I Black and proudly voting TRUMP

Send me your questions to answer live from later this afternoon
New Zogby poll highly respected but the media won report it because it gives me an even bigger lead 
touts CNN polls instead of their own Of course the NBC one shows him much higher Trump corrects them
Fox is using you for ratings They want u out of the race Refuse
could you make your interview with any more biased or
You are great
here is a Clinton insider who admitted Hillary started the whole Obama a Muslim
Why is Fox being so hard on u I don get itare they idiots
you go trumpy don back down I won
On the Muslim issue It might help if he actually supported Christians religious liberty rights
On the Muslim issue It might help if he didn take five years to visit Israel
I totally support you You have this Ga Girl vote
Thanks and for showing us how lopsided you are Use your own poll
The refused to use their just in poll numbers where I have a massive lead but instead used numbers where my lead is smaller 
Will be on now Enjoy 
thank you for your personal and financial sacrifices to make america great again
Carly Fiorina did such a horrible job at Lucent and HP virtually destroying both companies that she never got another CEO job offer Pres 
We are going to WIN and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN maybe better than ever before 
I am attracting the biggest crowds by far and the best poll numbers also by far Much of the media is totally dishonest So sad 
I have been leading big in all polls with two more today and The NBC poll is more than double next at 29 Fiorina has 11 
There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems Boxer killed her for Senate in California 
I will be on at 1030 will be releasing their new poll numbers Based on the debate results I should do wellwho knows 
CNN tried to destroy Donald Trump with vaccine autism question but he gave this AMAZING response

On my way to Iowa Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours See ya 
Christians need support in our country and around the world their religious liberty is at stake Obama has been horrible I will be great 
If I would have challenged the man the media would have accused me of interfering with that man right of free speech A no win situation 
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president do you really think he would come to my rescue No chance 
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something 
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him I don think so 
Looking forward to meeting the students of Urbandale High School tomorrow

Jeb bush couldn shine MR trumps shoesgive me a break Bushes are so over
Rove is suffering from defeatism
When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for 1000000 they got nastyWhat a waste of money that would have been

Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence It not a fence Jeb it a WALL and there a BIG difference 
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics A mess 
In a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed ASIANS 
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc Is he ashamed of the name BUSH A pretty sad situation Go Jeb

Vietnam Veterans Against McCain
The reason Trump is the man He wants Americans to work not illegal aliens they live better than we do illegally
has the balls to say what needs to be said and I love it
Donald Trump is the man And people don appreciate his honesty Thank you
I I KNOW without a doubt that DonaldTrump is THE ONLY ANSWER to get the out of this mess
I a veteran I not offended by Trump
I very sure that does things excellently
Can Be Bought
but McCain is not a hero McCain abandoned POW McCain lies
check out mccains record on blocking legislation  blocking Miapow records
Phoenix VA led the league in scandals McCain knew Did nothing
doesn need the influence peddlers money so he can be his own man So true
Well get your facts straight McCain was so bad he gave us Obama He gave arms to Islamic terrorists
Keep going on you can win
Wow new preference poll has DonaldTrump 11 points up Thank you 
FOX NEWSGet your facts straight Trump did not put down Vetshe put down a clown named McCain
your the only person who really wants to save America
i never felt more strongly about anything in my life you are the only person who can truly fix America
Ben Carson has not criticized Trump And there no need to mention Dr Carson education
we need your help Donald Make us great again
The more the media attacks you the more I know you are the right person for the job
Proud of you keep cutting through the and tell it like it is
Keep going Mr trump America needs you
America needs
Not a huge surprise all day TV is all about and nothing about BernieSanders
Your the opening story on every political showradio or tv
You nailed it on tonite You say what most middle class folks YELL at their TV every night  you speak 4 us
I convinced Let go Trump
You killing Jeb in the polls Keep it up
u hit a home run on THE FACTOR
ON TOP The GOP Democrats and media have all hit Here the result
It doesn matter what the media thinksIt matters what the American people think Keep It Up
I going to listen to LONG before I listen to georgelopez
SenJohnMcCain is always talking talking but nothing gets done These are living in hell
I watch anything that gives you a chance to share your views Go donald
Great interview Give Trump a hot mic and watch out It is the rawness the nonPC guy
I will be interviewed on tonight at 800 Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc 
Look how small the pages have become Looks like a tabloidsaving money I assume 
This story is no longer about John McCain it about our horribly treated vets Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans 
It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn do the Apprentice that they became upset w me They couldn care less about inclusion 
I agree 100 McCain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our Vets
rest of GOP only cries but Trump gets stuff DONE
the left is petrified of you Why else would they be attacking you so vigorously
Trump already hosts vets at his resorts What does Hillary do
Trump says things that no one else would even consider saying I agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
I believe we have passed that point There are Homeless Veterans in USA yet Illegal Aliens get Government Housing
hosts events around the 4our Long before a presidential run He loves our military
This is big criticism of the Republican field Speak truth and stop being so PC This is why resonates
At least we talking about the We weren a month ago
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans 
The ever dwindling which is worth about 110 of what it was purchased for is always hitting me politically Who cares 
Glad U R Man Enough 2 Speak the Truth in this Pathetic Politically Correct World
Trump is the only person we believe will actually set things right
My piece Trump I don need to be lectured
The truth hurts sometimes who careskeep telling it like it is
you have the guts and backbone this country politics has needed for years
Will make the best President ever
WE LOVE YOU TRUMP TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT
what do you say now
Voters LIKE tough and smart that why we are voting TRUMP 2016
Gotta love the honesty
trump for president
that all the career politicians do is talk
RN for 27 yrs Veterans have less benefits than medicaid recipients Thnx for speaking
Bravo for saying whats on most of Americans mind Lets make America great again
The left wing politically correct cannot handle big don giving the truthrealitykeep saying it like it is
They can handle you Donald so want you out the race well good luckbecause we know you won walk away Give it to them
McCain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our 19 TRILLION trainwreck including the VA debacle
My piece Trump I don need to be lectured 
I will be making some very big campaign stops next week  big crowds and tremendous energy MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The Republican Party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat  just like the last two times 
A true piece about the standing ovations I got yesterday 
The Veterans Administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly John McCain has done nothing to help them but talk 
John McCain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix He owes apology 
Why do they attack Mr Trump Because he has something they dont The ability of truth Trump is here
Mr Trump the only one telling the truth Liberals can stand the fact that your are leading in the poll
kick there ass Trump
I on the
Because she shoots straight like you do Mr Trump No bullsht Just TRUTH
Wow just wrote the definitive piece on what I said about John McCain 
One of the reasons I am no fan of John McCain is that our Vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians I will fix VA quickly 
Via Donald Trump John McCain Is A Loser 
Why would anybody listen to He lost an election that should have easily been won against Obama By the wayso did John McCain 
Congrats to the new Gov of Texas for taking a tough bold stance at the border Should have been done long ago by Perry 
I have a proven track record supporting our Veterans Veterans deserve universal access to care VA scandal proves politicians are inept 
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care 
It a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our Veterans 
I will make this right for our great Vets 
All he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything 
John McCain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for Veterans to successfully manage their lives 
The Veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years 
Captured or not all our soldiers are heroes 
In addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our Vets John McCain let us down by losing to Barack Obama in his run for President 
Just left Family Leadership Summit in Iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people I will be back soon 
Statement on John McCain 
I am now in Iowa getting ready to speak People are always amazed to find out that I am Protestant Presbyterian GREAT 
The 10 billion net worth is AFTER all debt and liabilities So simple to understand but is just plain dumb 
Ratings starved and does not cover me accurately Why can they get it right  it really not that hard 
Made a speech in Arkansas last night before a record GOP crowd Great spirit and amazing people MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
It driving the money losing post crazy that I am in their poll and they only write bad stories about me 
The liberal clown told her minions at the money losing to cover me as enterainment I am in Huff Post Poll

The joke around town is that I freed El Chapo from the Mexican prison because the timing was so good w my statements on border security 
Greatly appreciate yr wonderful comments this weekend People of great accomplishment should easily quality for prez
Isn it interesting that now that I in the polls the networks show polls that are a month old 
SAY IT LOUD SAY IT PROUD   WE WANT TRUMP
When will people and the media start to apologize to me for my statement Mexico is sending which turned out to be true El Chapo 
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into Mexico through the border We get the killers drugs crime they get the money 
El Chapo and the Mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the US 
The US will invite El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a US citizen because our leaders can say no 
but that what I been saying Very unfair treatment by the media 
Now that the Mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the US comes over border 
I hear that sleepy eyes will be fired like a dog from ratings starved Meet The Press I can imagine what is taking so long 
Trump however would kick his ass 
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with El Chapo the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison  
Sleep eyes is killing Meet The Press Isn he pathetic Love watching him fail 
Mexico biggest drug lord escapes from jail Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price I told you so

Letter to  Re 
If I win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare

I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them Really bad for US jobs only good for Mexico 
Univision wants to back out of signed contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the US makes with Mexico 
Mexican gov doesn want me talking about terrible border situation horrible trade deals Forcing Univision to get me to stop no way

Hopefully there won be any problems in Baltimore tonight Be calm be cooldo not let anybody get hurtThere is just too much to live for 
The best social program by far is a JOB Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries  incompetent leader 
President Obama you have a big job to do Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together With proper leadership it can be done Do it 
Our country has to come together We have to start working with and really liking each other The whole world is watching Baltimore 
Can we drop off in the middle of so he can show Obama how it done I would fix it fast
The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters space to destroy  another real genius 
Now that the ineffective Baltimore Police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the US taxpayers expected to rebuild it again 
Our great African American President hasn exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore 
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots SAD 
Wow 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore some badly Where is the National Guard Police must get tough and fast Thugs must be stopped

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 900 o in the evening What were they thinking 
Our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in Washington you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places 
Sadly because president Obama has done such a poor job as president you won see another black president for generations 
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the US economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson 
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the US as they watch the Ferguson riot 
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now 
Despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decadesIf Obama were a leader this would not be the case 
This is why we need in office doesn know how to keep order
can wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed
for president 2k16
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 900 in the evening  a prime time for riots Not smart 
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators 
ISIS is starting its own currency May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented 
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome

President Obama strongly considering a plan to bring nonUS citizens with Ebola to the United States for treatment Now I know he nuts 
Watch me on show at 10PM tonight on 
Success requires 100 of your focus and 100 of your effort Don sell yourself short 
Keep your momentum Without momentum a lot of great ideas go nowhere 
Mark Udall was the deciding vote for ObamaCare now 250000 Coloradans were dropped from their plans Vote 
John Foust is a liberal who supports ObamaCare and opposes Ebola travel ban Send Conservative to Congress 
I believe anybody who is not afraid to fail is a winner  
All the governors are already backing off of the Ebola quarantines Bad decision that will lead to more mayhem 
WH refused a meeting with the Israeli Defense Minister If only Obama hated Iran as much as he dislikes Israel 
The perfect getaway is Europe most elite 5star destination perfected with oldworld luxury 
A 34 story luxury highrise offers elite amenities with residences that maximize every inch of space 
ObamaCare has brought skyrocketing premium increases unaffordable deductibles which will lead to less care job losses 
Show me someone without an ego and I show you a loser
Definitely true

Donald Trump said that before the virus made it to US That what I do
you are my role model such an amazing man Thank you
This is why I agree with Donald Trump They should ban flights from infected countries from entering the US
easily he is one of the most intelligent among America He would win over Hilary THANKS
should run for president
Did Hillary really say Businesses don create jobs
There are just so many penalties and such long commercials in these NFL games that they are no longer worth watching Soft hitting boring 
I would absolutely consider investing in Atlantic City again great and hard working people but much would have to changetaxes regs etc 
Yes I won the right to have my name taken off Trump Plaza in AC because it was not operated up to a very high standard and NO involvement 
I made a fortune in Atlantic City got out years ago great timing and havn been back in many years I have NOTHING to do with AC 
With all that is happening with Ebola including the doctor who so easily came back to New York Obama still refuses to stop the flights 
I wish you would run For President Mr Trump we need you God Bless you
BarackObama as one of your employers Are you really just turning your back on Isreal Trump for I rdy 4 change

Oh Donald I love you
Trump you are great  you speak your mind and should continue to do so
President Obama you are a complete and total disaster but you have a chance to do something great and important STOP THE FLIGHTS 
President Obama has a major meeting on the NYC Ebola outbreak with people flying in from all over the country but decided to play golf 
I never thought I say it in my lifetime but President Barack Hussein Obama aka Barry Sotoro is a far worse president than Jimmy Carter 
I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa So simple but he refused A TOTAL incompetent 
Ebola has been confirmed in NYC with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact withObama fault 
If this doctor who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africahas Ebolathen Obama should apologize to the American people resign 
There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola Touched many bedlam

Please save this country
A man of business and success please run for president and fix this country

A smart POWERFUL and SUCCESSFUL man like Donald Trump would be the ideal president We need you Mr Trump
The United States troops which were sent to West Africa have only gotten 4 hours of Ebola training  very unfair to them and their families 
The United States under President Obama has truly become the gang that couldn shoot straight Everything he touches turns to garbage 
The US accidentally air dropped a large shipment of military weapons and supplies right into the middle of ISIS as enemy laughs Very sad 
Negotiation is an art Treat it like one 
Don believe Kay Hagan on Ebola travel ban She also promised that you would keep your healthcare plan under ObamaCare Vote 
Obama will let Ebola fly into US drugrunners cross our border daily But he won pressure Mexico on Sgt Tahmooressi 
I will be in Washington DC tomorrow to receive the 2014 Joseph Wharton Award at the Wharton Club of DCa great honor

President Obama I have an idea Pretend that West Africa is Israel and then you will be able to stop the Ebola area flights 
President Obama  close down the flights from Ebola infected areas right now before it is too late What the hell is wrong with you 
Please run for president
Something very important and indeed society changing may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing NO SHAKING HANDS 
This Ebola patient Thomas Duncan who fraudulently entered the US by signing false papers is causing havoc If he lives prosecute 
My advice run for president
If Ebola is so noncontagious how come an NBC cameraman caught it so quickly while over in West Africa US is behaving very foolishly 
Can you believe that President Obama still hasn stopped the flights and people pouring into the US from West Africa TERRIBLE PRESIDENT 
you are the Smartest man in america Why aren you president Who needs Obama We need you Please run
For President
I pray that one day my country will wake up and see that you are the leader we need Please run in 2016
Great minds never stop Such qualities make great leaders and fantastic decision makers
Obama isn smart enough to identify what the best and brightest would look like Please run for POTUS We need you

you are 100 right Enough is enough
Great questionagreed
They should pay us FREE OIL for the next 100 years
Donald in the House You nailed it down
Obama mind IsIs ebola etc and then thinking boy I wish I was on the golf coarse What should I wear on the Links
Tell Saudi Arabia and others that we want demand free oil for the next ten years or we will not protect their private Boeing 747sPay up 
Middle Eastern countries must participate militarily no running away and big league financially in order for us to go in and save them 
I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction Pay up now 
If Obama resigns from office NOW thereby doing a great service to the countryI will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses

Doctors have already died treating Ebola We should not be importing the disease to our homeland 
Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases Our leaders are inept 
Just bought a tie from it beautiful great style Great they are top quality at reasonable price
So many people are agreeing with me on not creating a highway for Ebola to the US Started in small area of Africa and now spreading fast 
I agree MT Doctor on agreed we should not bring into country in two patients bring docs to them
Your opinions on were outstanding and intelligent If only we could channel some of this common sense to the WH
I really like the collection quality is outstanding Feel like a wearing it
Any plans for a trump building in Toronto MrTrump Already have a great one Trump International hotel
In the end you measured not by how much you undertake but what you finally accomplish  Donald Trump
Our current government doesn have the balls to do what needs to be doneYet ANOTHER reason for you to Run

New York City hospital testing patient for possible Ebola infection Hello
The bigger problem with Ebola is all of the people coming into the US from West Africa who may be infected with the disease STOP FLIGHTS 
A doctor on NBC Nightly News agreed with mewe should not bring Ebola into our country through two patients but should bring docs to them

We should have taken the oil in Iraq and now our mortal enemies have got it and with no opposition Really dumb US pols I so angry 
Isis terror group has now fully taken over large sections of Iraq and will soon have control of massive oil reserves I told you so 
Mr Trump sir how many presidents from the last 50 years will you be better than when you become president All of them All
for prez 2016 cuz
I hate myself for following you But you just have no control over yourself you need Trump so badly
Explain He a pollster Yes but a really bad and boring one
works really hard but is a guy who just doesn have it  a total loser
He seems to be doing the right thing He taking a stand for America and asking 4 some common sense about Ebola
i agree it does seem crazy
They knew the risk when they went to Africa They choose it freely
Looking forward to my work week in and my favorite Rooftop restaurant best view
I find and his tweets thoroughly entertaining
The fact that we are taking the Ebola patients while others from the area are fleeing to the United States is absolutely CRAZYStupid pols 
The US must immediately stop all flights from EBOLA infected countries or the plague will start and spread inside our borders Act fast 
U need 2 run 4 office
To all the liberal do gooders this is the Plague you idiots No cure  You may have confidence in the CDC but I don
I agree
I agree 100
Yes  The government is bringing them back here so the outbreak can start here too
You are right about the Ebola patients It a deadly virus and they shouldn bring them to the US
you want sense  Listen to
If you read my last number of tweets only one opinion can be formed  that our President and therefore leader is grossly incompetent 
The ObamaCare website is in the news again  it is turning out to cost even more than previously thought AND IT DOESNT WORK Big trouble 
So many lives and two trillion dollars wasted and our worst enemies will get the 2nd largest oil reserves in the World Such stupid leaders 
Just as I have been predicting for years Iraq will fall to the people that hate the US the most  just outside of BaghdadKeep the oil 
The US cannot allow EBOLA infected people back People that go to far away places to help out are greatbut must suffer the consequences 
Why do you give Scotland so much money to destroy their magnificent land with wind turbinescausing massive taxes E bills

Mr Trump you are avoiding the responsibility of running for President since the nineties Be patriotic and run Watch

Big announcement tomorrow morning concerning the great Turnberry Resort in Scotland 
Congratulations to Martin Kaymer for winning the 2014 Great playing from beginning to end 
course didn look good in HD just saying No it looked terrible bad for golf
I concur with on Pinehurst IMO Those blasts from sandy areas looked like IEDs exploding In Kandahar Province
it was nice of you to give 15 minutes of fame that he wouldn have had I agree
you have made some great courses but dont think that gives you the right to comment on every golf course I agree
Matt how many club championships have you won I hear zero or 18 fewer than me Lets play for a lot
stick to media like everyone else in it with worthless opinions DonaldTrump is 10000 times more successful than you
Are the commercials filmed at Trump National LA Yes
played Trump Bedminster oncewill never forget it
big time I love Trump Bedminster
is barking up the wrong tree getting in a twitter war with I can beat him in golf even easier
Matt you know nothing about quality golf or what it takes to make golf successful You are all talk no substance
Actually agreeit may have been great to play but it looked atrocious on TVI love golfcouldn watch
I completely agree with DT here Pinehurst looks bad I wouldn pay 400 to play if it looked like that
future British open
I played the new Doral which is awesomeone day I hope to play another Trump course
I agree with the Donald What a goat track I take the beauty of Pebble any day
Sir Donald Rather than promote golf courses please use your influence to deliver messages that will help fix our Country
I played Pinehurst and Trump Bedminster and Donald has 2 in Bedminister that are superior Thank you true
Matt you don understand golf even though you think you doI have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst
I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry one of the great golf courses of the World Pinehurst not in the same league
My position on Pinehurst is correct  bad for the game a dried out cow pasture You have no clue but keep trying
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst Said they should be redone 
very subdue atmosphere Not take it away from Kaymer but it like watching paint dry
look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg True
please don let the USGA ruin your course in 2017 like they did Pinehurst I won
they think the course should be old school you know like before lawn care technology aka goats
I bet the horrible look of Pinehurst translates into poor television ratings This is not what golf is about 
he has a point fairways should be green Scruff can be as bad as you want Wouldn pay top dollar
Just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass You gave him a rewardgood job Donald Thanks
Worked  restaurant for 33 yrs got fired because they didn think I could keep up No severance Would u do that NO WAY
It worse for I know I wouldn pay 400 to play what looks like a neglected municipal course
I thought this was the US Open not the wanna be British Open
couldn agree more The course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would BORING FINISH
Big news from Scotland on Turnberry which by the way blows Pinehurst away tomorrow morning Stay tuned
Remember it was Martin K who sank the big ten footer to win the Ryder Cup He can handle the pressure

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the US left What a terrible waste of lives and money 
Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq take over the country oil and O will say thanks 
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst  and it isn even close Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral 
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out Actually they will take over Iraq and all of their oil Stupid US

i always tell people to vote for Donald Trump if he runs for president He knows the real deal
Call it any way you like but Snowden is a traitor When our country was great do you know what we did to traitors
Obama can strike a deal with the Taliban but can make a deal with congress
He got the president to show his Birth Certificate He has clout my friend He can really stir things up
I believe that in addition to the 5 terrorist leaders President Obama gave up for Bergdahl a great deal of CASH was also given So stupid 
Amazing view of 
Trump Collection summer line exclusively available is the pinnacle of style prestige Dress your best

Nearly anything would be more effective than Obama is the ideal candidate for this country restoration Thx
Obama can release 5 senior Taliban for a deserter but can make Mexico release decorated Marine Sgt Andrew Tahmooressi Pathetic

Chris McDaniel looks like he will win in Mississippi  GREAT NEWS and big victory for Tea Party 
Obama never consulted with Congress about a prisoner exchange HE BROKE THE LAW AND SHOULD BE TRIED OUR PRESIDENT IS A TOTAL DISASTER 
Are you allowed to impeach a president for gross incompetence 
Was Susan Rice told to lie about Bergdahl Obama and his representatives lie about virtually everything from ObamaCare to a deserter 
Thank you for a great and very accurate story  well done
If you interested in  work and pleasure stop Instead make your work more pleasurable  Donald Trump
Rapidly failing magazine hits me for my strong stance against Obama brilliant 5 killers for 1 deserter trade Amazing 
What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate Donald Trump
The five Taliban leaders released for a deserter must really be laughing and having a good time right now They are saying how dumb US is 
Our President is a great embarrassment to the US How could anybody be so dumb or know so little as to make the very stupid 5 for 1 swap 
The entrepreneur ability to dream to win lose and win again and again is often called the entrepreneurial spirit  Midas Touch 
Remember our six brave heroes who died searching for Bergdahl after he deserted ht 
The problem is that no government can create real jobs Only entrepreneurs can do that  Midas Touch 
It would be nice if our commanderinchief was as concerned for our Veterans health as he is for illegal immigrants becoming citizens 
Moving forward ftonight competitive primaries it is crucial that the Tea Party remain united towards November Take the Senate

Be sure to buy this month magazine Read A Trump Card my interview with Jeffrey Lord 
Because of our terrible leaders it is now open season on every American throughout the world Terrorists are thrilled 
President said we would never leave a soldier behind How about the 4 who died in Benghazi 
Great deal we swap 5 killer terrorists for a US military deserter That how the US negotiates nowadays 
Obama is actively destroying the greatest country in the world We are going to pay a horrible price for his recent actions
Who knew al Qaeda had such good negotiators Impressive 5 for 1 against the mighty USA
Bowe Bergdahl walked off the base after he was told not to Solders died looking for him US should NEVER have made the deal PUNISHMENT 
Only a grossly incompetent government led by an equally incompetent president could have made the terrible trade for Bergdahl 
That the Obama administration didn know the facts about who Bergdahl was before making the stupid 5 killers for one trade is pathetic 
Enjoyed seeing you on You should run for President You would get this great country going again
If you run as Donald Trump and not a Democrat or Republican the people will vote for you
Looking forward seeing on tonight Has my vote as the next Thanks

Cant wait to see you in the Oval Office Make America great again
all your towers are breathtakingProud of your charisma and versatility Thanks
is the right man for the job
That wouldn be hard to do True
2016 is your year Nobody better prepared to fix our country than you please run
Donald for President Thanks
I hope runs for ratings for debate nights would blow right out of the water
if you runit will be the first time I vote
The tower is crazy Absolutely in love
You are an inspiration to me and my friends
We need you You are the answer to this nations problems
running the US is much like running a business who better at that than The Donald
I not sayingTrump should necessarily be a 2 term president Give him 4 years and he can begin the restructuring of our economy
my econ teacher says ur the only one who can fix the economy if you run my whole school will vote for you
Trump boldy calls out problemsthen offers solutions opinions that excite the electorate just like Reagan
Your ties are amazing Thanks
How many people would vote for DonaldTrump if he ran I would if you can make in New York you can make it anywhere
I refuse to vote for anybody but Trump in the next presidential election He is the only man that can lead this corrupted country
So yeah the first vote I will ever cast for president will be Donald Trump bc who can really argue with Donald Trump
Ur biid 4 Prez n 2016 would make US top economic superpower encourage r allies slow or stop r enemies
President Trump would have America walking proudly talking loudly carrying big stick n foreign policy again
A successful bid would restore American exceptionalism entrepreneurship and leadership
for PRESIDENT Time for a CHANGE in the RIGHT direction
Donald please run
watching your cspan special from the other day I can get enough of it Thank you
The statement about leaving the base came directly from CBS Evening News 
you need to run for president like right now mister trump
If you don run in 2016 I moving to Canada Please help us Mr Trump Don move so fast
At some point Sgt Bergdahl will have to explain his capture In 2009 he simply wandered off his base without a weapon Many questions 
please run for president to save America my whole family is knows you the only man who can do it True
not long Obama plays with our emotion knowing we all love to see this soldier come home Stupid man
run in 2016 for the sake of future generations Obama and his friends are tearing America apart
Trump 2016 We need someone who not only wants to Change this country but can change this country Thanks
when the released prisoners kill Americans what does Obama say to their parents
wonder how long it takes the released terrorists to attack Americans
Just watched your speech at the National Press Club Fantastic as usual Please consider 2016 We need fantastic leadership
Now the enemy knows that capturing soldiers is worth it bc our idiot president will give them what they want
The US cannot negotiate with terrorists It is a sad and terrible situation for the family involved but this can only lead to disaster 
Run for president We need a leader not a politician So true
President Obama created a VERY BAD precedent by handing over five Taliban prisoners in exchange for Sgt Bowe Bergdahl Another US loss 
If you run for president I will absolutely vote for you and so will my familyfriends Great

If you looked over the yearsI been right on virtually every issue from Iraq not going in but if so taking the oil to jobs to China 
By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response he has singlehandedly made it target How totally stupid is this guy 
Watched his speech yesterdaypathetic Carteresque weak His delivery is so cautious not to offend absolutely zero True
This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components  not rolling over and dealing from weakness 
Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a regional power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC 
President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands He is not a natural leader was never ment to lead  it is tough work for him 
He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else  Benjamin Franklin

Obama must now FOCUS get his mind off MarchMadness and LEAD Watch Russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare 
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think  and could lead to World War III WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST 
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever Must be very strong to prosper survive 
I believe Putin will continue to rebuild the Russian Empire He has zero respect for Obama or the US 
Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity Obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers SAD 
Great advice from my mother Trust in God and be true to yourself  Mary MacLeod Trump 
Great advice from my father Know everything you can about what you doing  Fred C Trump

President Obama be cool be smart be sharp and FOCUS no more March Madness and you can beat Putin at his own game IT CAN BE DONE

Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOURE FIRED I do not like firing people But ZERO on ObamaCare messno way 
Why doesn President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie announce that ObamaCare was a mistake and deal a really great plan 
US froze 8B in Iranian assets during 79 Hostage Crisis Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed Don do it

Just got home watching the news and every story is bad about the US Someday we will return to being great again but we need leadership 
The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it  The Art of The Deal 
Why didn Obama as part of the negotiation free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini 
Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes Just think about that 
Who would you rather have negotiating with IranPresident Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford My money is on Ford 
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort You in charge Everything starts with you

After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars JPMorgan lawyer is critical of the amount of the finewhy did they settle thenDUMB 
Best book ever on dealmaking or so they say  TRUMP THE AOF THE DEAL Go get it and others Washington  you really can do better 
I know it has been many years since our country made great deals but isn it about time we start right now MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 
The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal especially one that is not complete is that it shows weakness to the other side 
John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran Great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one 
Tom Brady is a good friend of mine a great player a great guy and a total winner Fantastic comeback winthis is what our country needs

What a rotten deal we made with Iran We get nothing except laughter at our stupidity They get everything including delay and big cash 
They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn working 
The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare

Such a nice article in the New York Times about a wonderful developer Arthur Zeckendorf 
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule Harry Reid Obama killed it yesterday Rule was in effect for over 200 years 
Since the Democrats decided to kill the filibuster they now own itRepublicans should keep the new rule when they in the majority

For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack please remember the late great Charles Bronsonno more crime 
Weak newscasters are asking is there a racial component to knockout attacks Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse 
If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged and you carry a gun shoot the bastard teach them a lesson 
Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth We better start getting tough in this countryand they want to take our guns

Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare 
The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign and be sued for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy 
Donald we can allow this country to become soft like Obama and penn state Please run in 2016
I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming 
Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatoryracist and can be viewed as bullying

you could put in this same category TRUEWEAK

Thank you for saving new york from another Spitzer era We got lucky
Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY jobs healthcare and all of our many problems Forget Syria and make America great again 
Putin is having such a good time Our President is making him look like the genius of all geniuses Do not fearwe are a NATION OF POTENTIAL 
I said that Eliot Spitzer was going to lose when he was way up in the polls I fought him when others retreated out of fear NEVER GIVE UP 
Spitzer and Weiner lost lightweight Eric Schneiderman will be next  he will be challenged in the PRIMARY He has done a really poor job 
He must go People like him r destroying our country and our principals Re lightweight AG Schneiderman
my husband and I think you so awesome We can wait to come to NYC one day and see the Trump towers Great
is on a roll and its only 710a my time I love his enthusiasm If only everyone had his thought process
your passion for entertainment biz is so great that it bought you a name recognition outside business field
who should be the AG replacement Any thoughts There are a number of very good people
I worked for another self made man Elon Musk I have the greatest respect for both of you Thank you
Weiner is gone Spitzer is gone  next will be lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman Is he a crook Wait and see worse than Spitzer or Weiner 
Assad hit the jackpot 
Back to work for the President to try and keep some dignity for the office and himself The socalled rebels must be thoroughly confused 
The only reason Obama gave a speech last night was because it was on the schedulePutin is laughing and the reviews have been really bad 
you are the greatest Thank you I will be working hard on that
Think Weiner will move to a state that doesn know him He should move better for him to make a new start
Lightweight Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will be next to lose He goes after a school with a 98 approval ratingleaves biggies alone 
Lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman asked us for political contributions DURING his investigation of usthen sued for 40 millionDopey guy

Youre welcome We did it Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spit
I remember when Schneiderman was 2nd in command to Patterson on the D side Can you believe those two
Thank you to all of my Twitter followers for helping to defeat Weiner and Spitzer Remember in the beginning they said it couldn be done 
I fought hard against Spitzer and Weiner and both lost For a while when Spitzer was way up it seemed that I was a lone voice Good power 
What will you miss most about Wiener Absolutely nothing
Give credit where it is due NYC voters chose correctly
Wow Eliot Spitzer has lost  great news for New York City 
Bottom line I don think President changed people minds  must hope for a lifeline from Putin a very dangerous lifeline at that 
We will have to see what Russia next move will be They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess 
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit 
why wasn Obama more concerned wBenghazi killed Syria not our business
Doesn want to remove Assad  worries what comes next 
Making his case in a nice and articulate manner 
Does he look sharp smart and presidentialhis hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noisemicrophone too sensitive 
Here we go 
Will be covering President Obama speech at 900 on Twitteryou are all so lucky 
I honestly think our next president should be  People can say what they want but dude seems to have it
he has kept his campaign pledge to fundamentally transform Americafor the worse

Putin is making O and Kerry look like chumps
The birth certificate that you forced Obama to show is a computer generated forgery
everything you say is true and I respect you because your not afraid to say it
You will knock the President anyway Wrong I would love to see him do a great job but it not working that way
The 0bama presidency has been a disaster for America
Putin is much smarter than Obama No surprise his tactics
you want to send more Americans out to war Why don you sign up I am against an attack on Syria dummy
Red line statement was a disaster for President Obama 
This new Russian strategy guarantees victory for the Syrian governmentand makes Obama and US look hopelessly bad President in trouble 
You are a great American Thanks from a Vietnam vet

Why does a network allow a stupid racist like Toure to stay on the air when his ratings are so abysmal Can there be only one reason

Former President Jimmy Carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst President in the history of the United States 
Syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas A polititian war

I am not angry at Russia or China because their leaders are far smarter than ours We need real leadership and fastbefore it is too late 
I wonder how much our leaders have promised or given Russia in order for them to behave and not make the US look even worse 
Really bad news just announced concerning jobs Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated Interest rates therefore to remain low 
We don have the leadership including the Generals who just said the element of surprise does not matter to attack anyone Cool it 
Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack Far too late 
Well quit yapping about and run for office I like your ideas DO IT
TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT  Thanks
I wish you run for office The country needs more minds like yours Thank you
In this case What would you do if you were the President I rebuild the US and make it great again

While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities 
If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the rebels executing prisoners you would say forget the rebels 
Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world Make America great again 
god your the best Mr Trump I like you tooooo
haha I love how you just tell like it is You aren who you are by not doing just that Thank you
The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement Do NOT attack Syriafix USA 
President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE Amazingly now he denies he said that

To be a champ you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will True
never tell your enemy when where and how you are going to hit them
If two of your competitors were at war would you let them destroy each other Or would you back one
Just finished of the deal Brilliant insight into your mind thanks
you realize that is what Iran wants dont you You beat Iran in a much different fashionnot through Syria
For all of those fools that want to attack Syria the UShas lost the vital element of surpriseso stupidcould be a disaster 
What I am saying is stay out of Syria 
The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton real leaders and fighters are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info time to prepare 
mr trump would attack Syria or no No lets make our country great again as they fight their war
I just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things 2 the pointThanks
can General Dempsey tell Obama delaying Syria bombardment will have no consequences He no Patton
If u r so disappointed at Obama why don u run for president in 2016 Watch
is the kind of president we need True
mr trump for president Thank you

I applaud Columbia South Carolina for cleaning up biz center Will cut crime advance commerce 
why the hell are you always criticising Obama Because he is doing a terrible in fact embarrassing job
President Obama Arab Spring is not looking so good right now 
If the government just listened to this country would be so much better
But if we had a Republican President you would say the exact opposite right Wrong
Think of it the Arab League doesn want to get involved with Syria  but they want us to do their dirty work How stupid 
If the US attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets killing civilians there will be worldwide hell to pay Stay away and fix broken US 
Our country is looking very bad right now 
trump tower here in Chicago is such an impressive building and architecturally really fits in with the area

I hope runs for president For obvious reasons
Donald have you noticed how so many people want you to run Amazing I think you will win handily Thanks

please run for POTUS 2016 America desperately needs a TRUE leader with common sense Thank you
Roast of will be the best one since OK as long as mine remains number one
with all due respect Bush did exactly the same thing in Iraq You will seldom see me defending Bush
it so bad there are actually maps of targets now in where USA ships would attack from
Thanks
In war the elememt of surprise is sooooo importantWhat the hell is Obama doing 
That the plan Have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life I am stunned daily
you should be our next President This country would be in much better shape if you would have run in 2012True
Why isn president instead of Obama  That is truly a good question
We have given Syria so much time and informationthere has never been such an instance in wartime history Syria is now fully prepared 
Why isn the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves 
The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria but they want us to attackAre our leaders insane or just stupid 
Any chance you change your mind and run for President Time will tell
How would you treat the Syria situation if president  I let them all fight with each otherfocus on US
I always looked up to Business and Politics He the man Thank you
My son Joey survived leukemia He is is now 13 Thank you MakeaWish and NCCF for everything they did
It is truly amateur hour at the White House  and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now 
So true
you should be President  Save America Thank you
President Obama weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly in more ways than money attack on Syria 
Good luck
You always have something negative to say about Obama dont you Yes
You have real talent
just bought some beautiful Trump cuff links  Great
Happy birthday
Thank you
wondering if u know or care that tomorrow begins childhood cancer awareness month
Donald you are antiObama no matter what Obama does you will take the opposite view WRONGall on merit
Obviously amateur hour at the WH Obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so
he no Churchill He might not even be Jimmy Carter
Just from reading his tweets it seems like could run our country much better than our President right now
Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us He couldn even get Britain NO LEADERSHIP 
Thank you
can say Obama doesn know how to throw a polite war General Patton would not be happy right now
I scared for my future You should be
Be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III 
China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortuneamp laugh at us 
Obama now just wants to save face Russia is now telling him don do it He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared 
Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes Call it the PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR 
may be many things but one thing he is is right Thank you sort of
Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk  they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsAmazing 
For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack 
The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syriabig mistake if he does not 
if trump was POTUS we would have all the money we need 2016 That true
the president of Syria is killing people inhumanly But the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse
I usually agree with you not tonight Stop criticizing The PresidentI will when he makes good decisions
I would be totally surprised if the US even HAS any money to spend on Syria We don
We need a strong minded POTUS in office before we enter into another war
what would you do  give a solution vs being so critical I would make America great again
for once the UK has seen sense and not been dragged into this They were for once very smart
he to soft of a president Incompetent would be a better word
Not to mention we probably don have the money to spend on another long war So true
How bad has our leader made us look on Syria Stay out of Syria we don have the leadership to win wars or even strategize 
If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the US will look very bad 
Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria Our leaders don know what they are doing

talk shows are stale But a daily look at the inside wheeling and dealing of the Trump Org Exciting
So true
A talk show is a great idea Please make the time sir The country needs you now more than ever
A talk show would be the perfect arena for you Mr Trump Ratings would soar through the roof But no time
You should have your own talk show Networks and many have asked but I don have the time Thanks

Tanjanever give up
The United States needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first 
Let the Arab League take care of Syria Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack 
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria watch Russia as they say in the movies SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER 
I wonder what the great generals like Patton the big M or Robert E LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack 
No dopey I would not go into Syria but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools
the one who talks much does nothing Except make 10 billion dollars  go get a job dumbass
Why Obama is giving up the element of surprise in Syria Perhaps because he is stupid
a few billion more dollars but I rather say  President Trump than President Gates
That said the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess not usWe should start rebuilding our own country military 
Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria Why can we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise 
I give the President speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 Not bad but room for improvement 
Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington He doesn want to detract from his press glory 
One day I hope to be successful a bit controversial like keeping things interesting classy Go for it
Actually I think it was factual and right on the mark You are a vulture sir nothing more Thank you
what was racist about that story The story wasn racist just inaccurate and wrong Bryant is dumb racist
Jeff has been battling cancer for years Huge fan and Trump supporter as am I

Not concerned about themweren they brutally mugging people in the Park Go check your facts
ASK HIM ABOUT CENTRAL PARK 5 Yea ask me about the muggers
Likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities These people want LAW AND ORDER now

Sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanicsa tough subjectmust be discussed

The sexual abuse that is so rampant has according to generals greatly weakened our military They have failed to stop it 
Just inall efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failedin fact the stoppers have become the abusers 
is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice charitable that they employ the notalent illiterate hack

Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in not me of course there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them 
I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there kept the oil DUMB 
Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so politically correct or we won have a Country to run anymore 
Many generals and military leaders are now saying I told you so They say this will have big impact on military strength national sec 
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control 
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wifeWhat is going on 
America top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet controlForces greatly hurt 
do you like LeBron as a player and person LeBron is a great player and a great guy

Mark Cuban is a bully who is physically very soft and therefore should immediately stop wearing T shirts No strength
can hold acandle to DonaldTrump  he is a laughing stock in Great Britain but his show pays me lots of money so I happy
The success of Shark Tank over the years is a total joke compared to the success of The Apprentice one of the biggest hits in TV history 
But I love insulting people who don have the goods but think they do
The Apprentice on the other hand has been a MAJOR television hit often times finishing Even now after 13 seasons it wins its slot 
is a short ball hitter who had a massive failure on television The Benefactor Now he is one of many on a modest ratings show S T

As I said many times before Jon Stewart is highly overrated 
Jon Stewart is a total phony he should cherish his pastnot run from it 
If Jon Stewart is so above it all legit why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz He should be proud of his heritage 
What funny about the name Fkface Von Clownstick  it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz he stole it from some moron on twitter 
Amazing how the haters losers keep tweeting the name Fkface Von Clownstick like they are so original like no one else is doing it 
Most people think small because most people are afraid of success afraid of making decisions afraid of winning The Art of the Deal

Failed show I have never heard of you and was told you are a loserafter reading your credits I have no questions about it 
Next year should be the comedian at the White House Correspondents dinner The only problem is that

Mr Trump I personally enjoy your tweets Some are very informative Thank you for your words of wisdom
Scotland does not have free press even when you are just stating the factsit crazy 
Big pollution during manufacturing and building process

this from the guy who advocated freedom for mike Tyson Oh I guess I not a racist
Why don you just block the morons that try annoy you They make me feel even smarternot worth the effort
What other attacks Read the transcripts etc
they were wildin they were creating a nuisanceand they were viciously attacking and robbing people
so should the makers of this documentary be fired No but they should state the true factsno angels
Where is the evidence  All over the place
the point of the documentary is that they were innocent  they were attacking innocent people in the Park
Didn some other guy admit to actually committing this brutal crime Yes but they committed other attacks
Great
They were viciously attacking other people in the Parknice guys
I have many great people but also an amazing number of haters and losers responding to my tweetswhy do these lowlifes follownothing to do 
Jon Stewart is not a match Go Mr Trump Thanks I will

but then there would be no celebrity apprentice I would die without it And so would others
Thanks
i firmly believe that is the most superior troll on the whole of twitter that is allA great compliment
Jon Stewart is MUCH smarter than you Jon L isn even close
but they didn do it you wished death on innocent children  who were brutally attacking people in Park
Advertising Standards Authority has ruled antiwindfarm ad misleading Not misleading very truthful
The Central Park Five documentary was a one sided piece of garbage that didn explain thehorrific crimes of these young men while in park 
Victim never died so they would not have been given death penaltybut did you see what these innocent boys were doing
Advertising Standards Authority has ruled antiwindfarm ad misleading Political ruling to save joker Salmond
Perhaps but the Country is in really big trouble I do love real estate though and am seriously good at it
Please run for president Jon Stewart would destroy you Jon L is not smart enough
They devalue everything stupid
like ugly bird killing wind turbines
The Chinese talk of climate change and carbon footprint but don clean up their factoriesbut they sell us the equipment to clean up ours 
Wrong used to be called global warming and when that name didn work they deftly changed it to climate changebecause it freezing 
Why dont you just get in there and run for President you got all our votes Thanks
Wind turbines will quadruple your electric bills and destroy the value of your home Lot of chicken soup howeverbird kill
No the Chinese will make them
And now Ur an expert on gun control  Is there anything Ur not an expert on No

The dying circulation has dropped its newsstand sales have plummeted by 201 percent 
don worry my ad will be shown across the worldand it is highly accurate
This past Sunday AllStar Celebrity continued to win the key demographic of adults 2554 An amazing run 
I always been a fan of Steve Jobs especially after watching Apple stock collapse wout him  but the yacht he built is truly ugly 
It freezing in New Yorkwhere the hell is global warming 
The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his  Gen George S Patton 
In three years people won be building wind turbines anymore  they are obsolete totally destroy the environment in which they sit 
I sorry you feel terrorists deserve to enjoy the just system setup by the united states You are nuts
you are the best ive been a supporter since i was old enough to read Thanks Adam
Yes
Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference  Winston Churchill 
If your enemies end up liking you it because they beat you You want their respect not their friendship 
Macy ships to Canada Just go to

Savannah work hard in school
Actually the first of many Trump ties because of look feel quality
I know you wear mainly Brioni ties That wrong I wear Trump ties that are sold at Macy
Donald  they are top notch I have a dozen or so Thanks people love them
Me by a lot 
I say if Obama is so set on universal background checks we run a background check on him Very interesting
Will be doing Fox and Friends at 7 AM in 20 minutes

You need to run for President and get this country back on the right track Trump 2016 Thank you
You are a terrible human being That only because you don know me
My ties and shirts are doing very big numbers beyond my wildest thoughts Thanks and the rest of the losers for mentions 
What did you think of the boardroom 
George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004 A great time 
George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together He a tough negotiator 
Looking forward to book of Buseyisms 
Romance or Adventure what do you prefer 
For you newcomers George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice 
George has a real twinkle about him says Really The shark should be scared 
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams 
This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of and 
George Ross could be right would be better in the adventure task than the romance task 
isn excited about their ideas Are you
is making no attempt to help Is he in BuseyLand Their team is short on help already
How stressed are and already 
I hope you are watching the Apprenticetonight show is great and Brett Michaels is back 
Everybody loves He a great champion and this is where he should be He agrees 
and George Ross are back as advisors Good to see them
presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a 40000 check for Sandy Relief You can tell he very pleased about thatamp rightly so
Seems like the teams are surprised when comes back 
What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well I suspect he may talk 
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better Once he is well he will say speak to my lawyers 
Don forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pmyou will love it 
I don know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning 
Great sportscaster Al Michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National LA He was in perfect shape 
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand 
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards 
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse 
BullshitPop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money split between brothers and sisters and I built it into over 9 bill 
just a playboy
Tell me what were they doing in the Park playing checkers
Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprenticesome really crazy things happen 
Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9 It will be a full two hour show 
do you try to make everything about you YES
Great
You are right the media is always offending Donald Trumpthey have no limitsbut they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer 
I know some of you may think l tough and harsh but actually I a very compassionate person with a very high IQ with strong common sense 
Didn the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away We are not dealing with an innocent baby hereDEATH 
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killingsmaimings 
I hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as the suspect 
The shirts and ties at Macy are so goodbeautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piecel kicked his ass 
I just won a big Court decision NY Post against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties 
Oh no they are worried that they didn read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument 12 year case to finish t 
how do u feel about Marco Rubio Drinks too much water

Is the Boston killer eligible for Obama Care to bring him back to health 
Read my tweets you dopesof course he should get a trialbut fast not a 12 year disaster 
You must be kiddingzero chance he is innocent 
Tell the victims and their families about this guy rights Terrible
what good will killing himher do He never kill againand others will start to think about consequences
Maybe Anthony Weiner can serve as editor in chief But then would become Xrated
Get ALL the info then quick trial then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people Do not be kind 
I just watched the documentary It was a onesided piece of garbagea total disgrace

No I saying that the World is paying the price for China pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories Very sad 
When will NYT write about vaccine damage and its price 3 girls w autism here Mr Trump They should Kim
Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG Rest of World pays 
China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World by far They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity 
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it which they don China economy would collapse without us 
why is not the president of the US right now A very good question
Very well said The United States needs people like you to show what truly leadership means So true
what is the solution Mr Trump LEADERSHIP
What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea  NOTHING 
North Korea is reliant on China China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders 
should be president he knows what he is talking about Thank you

Haters stop saying I went bankrupt it is not so I never went bankrupt 
but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage
For the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals 
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool 
Icahn Kravis Apollo and most othersbut nobody says they went bankrupt
People buy deals immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals 
It is very effective and a commonly used business tool
Why do the losers haters always say I wear a wig when they know I don Like it or not it all minejust ask Barbara Walters 
Win

Via Trump to Sequester Cuts Don Go Far Enough 
Thanks
Thanks good questiongood point
Thanks
I will
Thanksthe big question is why
is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs working at home She is doing a great job
An individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me 
So far he has been a complete failure at doing so He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career 
The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazingthe funny thing is he can stand them 
Speaker John Boehner who I like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it 
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool 
People buy deals immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals 
It is a very effective commonly used business tool

A lot of people are concerned about which charity my 5M will be donated to The onus is on Obama to first release his records 
President Obama if it is important to you I will substantially increase the 5M offer 
President Obama please take the 5M check for charity tomorrow It is so easy and could do so much good 
Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of My honor 
Congratulations to on getting the endorsements 
Spoiler has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of 
International Reality will be America premiere real estate brokerage house w the most distinctive services
How does a dummy like get a television showamp his ratings stink You think could do a lot better 
A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama lack of transparency I don blame them 
There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the 5M to a charity of Obama choice once he releases all of his records 
Looking at the figures and plans behind acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid cont 
acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue
In the spirit of transparency Obama should immediately release the 911 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi 
Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater 
How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week Another scandal ignored by the liberal media 
Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate and I would be a star 
An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel A must read by friends and foes of President Obama End date is tomorrow at noon 
called me a master marketeer last nightI am not I am a great builderI build great things people come

Part 1 of my interview discussing my 5M offer to Obama Tower atrium my tweets 57th st crane 
Kevin Garnett response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitornothing wrongin fact it was terrific A champion 
I was standing with when a young high school star Kevin Garnett said to a crowd Forget Shaq I want to meet Donald Trump 
Watch the clip from where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency 
I not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my 5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go 
The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up 5M for his favorite charity Looking like he won be doing it What is he hiding 
Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy FallonPhoto Lloyd BishopNBC 
The polls momentum are trending towards Don let the hurricane change your thinking 
Fans shouldn worry We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of appropriately due to the storm 
China stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses Their market gains the day we are hit by storm 
Maybe Obama should donate my 5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm 
Scary Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over 5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years 4 more years 
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out 
Why does Obama believe he shouldn comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition Hiding something 
if you think PresObama should release his records to get 5M for charityfor Red Cross or another great charity
Glad to hear that will be cohosting the Grammy nominations special on 125 Taylor is terrific 
Let be honest if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in Ohio on Monday 
How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 912 the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi 
Without focus it just impossible to be successful at anything Midas Touch 
I never fall for scams I am the only person who immediately walked out of my Ali G interview 
Another great cause Obama could send my 5M donation to is a charity for 911 First Responders They are American heroes 
My interview discussing the 57th St crane damage from the storm and extending my 5M offer to Obama 
My interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm 
These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4 GDP Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history 
The election is trending towards Americans know we can afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline 
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help  I say thanks to you 
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place kept thousands of people warm safe during the stormthanks staff 
Remember this Obama wants to raise taxes wants to lower taxesneed I say more 
Don let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states 
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium  unlike others I stayed open 
I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap I would have been lambasted from coast to coast 
Because of the hurricane I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday 
Not only giving out money but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President  don fall for it 
Hurricane is good luck for Obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars 
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm 
The water damage to NYC is amazing The winds were bad but the water was worse 
All weights are on crane wrong side  very precarious below move out 
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower call office 
Direct view of crane from apartment window Crane was never properly secured blowing in the breeze 
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atriumthey are seeking refuge Free coffee and food 
So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY not nearly as bad as stated on news Let see what happens later 
Many people walked out on Madonna concert when she told them to vote for Obama Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible 
I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country The storm could be very good for him as he cont 
Obama lied 100 about Libya and the killingsemails are absolute He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies 
Dave Letterman said during my interview that Obama was probably born in the USthe word probably is a disaster for Obama 
I not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my 5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go 
What people don know about is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early cont 
I guess saw my ratings on the the other night where Letterman beat Leno Bill you are no Letterman 
While is an extremely unattractive woman I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct 
talks about my hair but I not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body  so I won Is this a double standard
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers  I agree 
A lot changed when David Letterman said  he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for Obama 
is taking major heat for calling the president lazy But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy Fight on John
That more than OReilly did and he is supposed to be my friend You terrific
McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on OReillyyou terrific
AlertThe president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in Benghazi He did nothinghe is no leader 
tries so hard to be a star But he just doesn have what it takesand he never will
I put on Apprentice at his request I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement 
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President 
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show I know more about people who get ratings than anyone 
Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was professionally dead I saved her tiny 
I hear they are very unhappy w Arianna and at I bet she won be there for long 
Donald Trump Tells About His Obama Announcement PASSPOAPPLICATIONS TELL YOU A LOT by 
Watch Obama favorability numbers drop even further if he doesn accept my charitable offer No one approves cont 
If Obama doesn accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say 
If my offer is refused every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied 5M to charity all because he is hiding something 
Barack Obama has everything to gain Why would anyone ever deny 5M to charity 
Great Last night winner alumni packed OH stadium rallying w 
Donald Trump Defends His Big Obama Bombshell It Not a Publicity Stunt via 
Sarah Jessica Parker voted unsexiest woman alive  I agree She said it beneath me to comment on the 
I have decided to add a caveat to my offer Obama can decide to send my 5M to Rev Wright if he releases his records 
My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohiomake sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day Know you can Must win Ohio 
Where the transparency Despite Obama denial stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright 
Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight Dutchess County dinnerto a SOLD OUT crowd It will be great fun 
Pretty audacious for Obama to call a BSer when he has lied about so much we don have room to write 
By the way where is Good question 4 years ago she strongly supported Obamanow she is silent Anyway who cares I adore Oprah 
Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction 
Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester The Middle East is a mess Yet Colin Powell still endorses him Wonder why 
Be careful of an Obama bomb to win election Would be a horrible thing to do 
The election is still close but trending toward He leads all national polls and Obama likeability is imploding VOTE 
Wow Letterman show won the ratings last night big timeand guess who was his guest DJT 
One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer give 1250000 to each family of the four 
Watch me explain on the how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency 
A clip from last night where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades 
True
What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the How much longer will Arianna lastI predict not much 
Thanks I hope you enjoyed it had a great time
I agree
Thanks it was a great show
Thanks I will
Stupid Arianna hired the man who ruined the oncegreat NYTimes Business Section 
a real loser named Tim OBrienand it never recovered 
Dopey Arianna is really after meboring story after boring storybut I hear she is in big trouble 
I knew last year that Magazine lost all credibility when they didn include me in their Top 100 
I will soon start naming magazines that I think will foldI predicted Newsweek
Great idea
I hope so for the charity sake
Thanks Tylar
The Letterman show really turned things around people finally understand my 5 million dollar offer to charity 
I love the Wounded WarriorsObama should choose that as his 5M charity
Sounds like a good idea
Only because he has something to hide
Re Taylor and Conorgreat news for Taylor
Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman audience I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw 5M down the drain 
instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause 
Another great charity that the 5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres  the Wounded Warriors represented so well by 
Lots of response that Obama should give the 5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi 
Letterman was great last night I had a lot of fun You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the  for charity 
The dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants The America We Deserve 
It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop 5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent 
Doing David Letterman tonight at 1130 1st nite of SweepsGoing into the lion den but I been there many times before Enjoy 
Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires 
For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt tax returns you would think my offer to donate 5M to charity for his records is an easy go 
Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants wind turbines manufactured here in China I don think this was a gaffe 
China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports We need to rein them in 
I hope Derek Jeter recovery is going well He is a very special player and a great guy New York loves him 
Trump Offers To Donate 5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts via 
has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting
What will be the response on Wednesday If Obama doesn take the 5 million dollars for charity 
I fully supported McCain but when he lost hoped Obama would be great for US  he wasn
shouldn be too upset over He will always do great
I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute 5M to any charity of his choice Everyone wins Take the deal 
Our side needs Donald Trump  on show last night Thanks Ann 
did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season and more than once

Donald Trump Announcement 5 Million for Obama College Records via 
Trump offers 5 million for Obama college passport records By 
Just stated by a total pro You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking 
Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the convention 
In light the Benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public 
By releasing his records he can come clean with the American people and have 5 million go to a charity
Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets Why can he release his records Especially when 5M is going to charity 
I am happy to donate 5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people 
to Obama 5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records
I just learned that has no credibilitytotal phonies that don report the truth A puppet of Obama 
Glad to hear supports my offer to Obama As Sean says it is an easy 5 million to charity What does Obama have to lose 
Third rate took every negative tweet or response they could find put it outwhen in fact the response is incredibly positive 
My offer to Obama is about transparency In 2008 American people were sold on hope and change This our last chance to get the full record 
Trump to give 5 million to charity if Obama releases records
Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain Bill Clinton George HW Bush and George W Bush 
The response has been fantastic actually overwhelming Thank you 
As stated here is the press release 
You have all been waiting the response has been amazing Watch my announcement now press release to follow at 1215

If you like having the world collapse and being told America is leading from behindvote Obama 
No wonder is in such big trouble boss was just firedthey are lost 
should never have played that piece of garbage documentaryamp yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course
that it was hard not to end up rooting for Trump 
Thank you to reviewer who stated You Been Trumped was so biased in favour of the protesters 
did an excellent job as debate moderator last night I only wish Mitt was more aggressive
Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert KristenI don have time except to say Robert drop her she cheated on you will again 
Last night was the first time Obama said we instead of I in respect to Bin Laden killing 
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden now he wants all of the credit 
My announcement is tomorrow 
Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject 
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own 
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden killing not the President 
should have been more aggressive last night Yet some polls have him winning the debate
My interview discussing last night presidential debate my stock picks and tomorrow big announcement 
The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden death not Obama who works hard to take cont 
When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden is there anyone with a brain that would not have said Ok go get him 
Doesn the US have better things to do than to destroy an American hero for the world to see Now other cont 
Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years then just ran out of energy Very sad storyalthough they caught him red handedHe definitely cheated 
Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent from a director point of view  Steven Spielberg 
No matter what happens in the election deserves a lot of credit He has kept Obama in it even with his terrible record 
I always said that had to keep fighting the charges By stopping he gave his enemies an opening 
70 of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago At least someone has done well under Obama 
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama failed foreign policy and I mean much more 
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night Viewership will be way down 
I will be doing at 730 
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden 
looks much calmer and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight Always treated me fairly 
Well this is it the final debate let see how it goes I be tweeting live 
Former Obama White House economic adviser gave his old boss a C on the economy Pretty generous 
Why don we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden They don seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit All he did is say OK 
I look forward to hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs 
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obamajust wait and see 
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart In a couple of years he will thank me Be smart Robert 
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy has many openings to attack especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden 
This is my last election After my election I have more flexibility Obama to discussing our nuclear arsenal 
Obama planted that story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight debate He wants Libya and China off the table 
The brass in Tower atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork I keep the atrium impeccable Key to its success 
I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on He drove you insane but of course Piers is a lot smarter than you
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick very thrilling 
I wish tonight debate would cover more than foreign policy 
Don let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get electedbe careful Republicans

Trump Was Right Obama America Tops 2012 Documentaries via

Obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively 
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama aka Barry Soetoro looked like a president last night I don 
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal If we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period 
I still love Derek he is a winner 
Remember I said Derek don sell your Trump World Tower apartmentits been lucky for you The day after he sold it he broke his foot 
At the debate the President kept talking of what he is going to do I kept saying why didn he do it He lost me a long time ago 
Verlander pitched great but look truly defeated 
Stupid George Will gave no chance 3 months ago Take off his little spectacles and he just another dummy 
George Will said best debate he ever saw If you ever heard George Will speakboring anything is exciting 
Debate showed these guys really hate each other At one point it looked like they would come to blows 
Obama better than last time but again wins Good night 
You talk tough Mr President but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy 
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama No wonder nothing gets done 
much better on Libya and Middle East problems Obama has no answer
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton he is no Bill Clinton 
Obama weak on immigration All words no action He been Prez 4 years 
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak is looking strong and sharp 
Obama just said was a very successful investor big mistake for Obama to admit he has less and less credibility 
Obama keeps saying that he will do something but why hasn he done it It all talk 
looks much stronger and much more Presidential
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices

They found Jessica in Colorado body was mutilated death to the pervert killer 
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series
