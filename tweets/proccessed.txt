rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50 which is higher than obama and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are somewhat low they know they are lying when they say it turn off the show  fake news
rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49 a far better number than i had in winning the election and higher than certain sacred cows other trump polls are way up also so why does the media refuse to write this oh well someday
rasmussen just came out at 51 approval despite the fake news media they were one of the three most accurate on election day just about the most inaccurate were cnn and abc newswashington post and they haven changed get new pollsters much of the media is a scam
rasmussen now beats 3836 nationally

that is beautiful
that is for sure  congrats on your appearance at rlc2014 in new orleans trump 2016 thanks
that is genius
that is great this is a show that teaches you real skills  very few shows on tv actually do that
that is indeed true
that is not the reason
that is something to think about isn it
that is true
that is why i like mr trump he speaks the truth and stands by it
that is why we don need a politician to be the next president
that isn even a real number nice try you will see donald trump by a landslide in 2016
that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump

that why he is so successful he is driven to succeed true
that why i never be pope
that why so many huge deals are closed on a golf course  trump 101
that why someone not in politics needs to run for president i think you know a guy
that why the man cannot be bought by establishment media pundits theyrmad
that why we are angry the republican establishment will not suppoyou you are who the american people want
that why we need and want you to run for president
