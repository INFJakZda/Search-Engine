Viral photos showing detainees at the U.S.-Mexico border in steel cages caused outrage online, with many social media users calling out U.S. President Donald Trump for unethical immigration practices.It’s unclear why they resurfaced on social media, but Trump took to Twitter Tuesday to condemn Democrats for spreading false information about immigration.While this photo may not be from the time of Trump’s presidency, the discourse surrounding immigration has been tense.That number is expected to jump once Trump’s new “zero tolerance” policy is enacted, which would enforce criminal charges against people crossing the border illegally with few or no previous offences.
