President Donald Trump can do many things on Twitter. He can call a former FBI director “slippery” and a former president “cheatin’.” He can spontaneously SWITCH TO ALL CAPS and claim media organizations are “fake news.”But now there’s one thing a federal judge says Trump can’t do: Block users because of dissenting political opinions.U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in New York ruled last Wednesday that Trump violates the First Amendment when he blocks critics on Twitter. The decision is the most prominent among a string of similar cases against public officials and could mark a turning point for constituents who interact with government employees on social media.Though the ruling stopped short of ordering Trump to unblock users, it made clear that people have a right to reply directly to politicians’ accounts when they are being used as public forums to conduct official business.Trump has blocked both celebrities — including author Stephen King and model Chrissy Teigen — and lesser known social media users.The case decided last week was brought by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University on behalf of seven critics of Trump whom his account blocked.When someone like Trump blocks people, it prevents them from seeing his feed and replying to his tweets. It’s also possible for Trump to mute accounts, after which he would simply no longer see tweets and replies from those accounts —an action that some say has fewer First Amendment implications.Trump is far from the only public official who has blocked opponents. After filing a public records request with 22 federal agencies and all 50 U.S. governors last year, news organization ProPublica found the offices that responded had blocked 1,298 social media accounts.
