ABOVE: Trump admin backs rule separating immigrant parents from their kids, blames Democrats. Ivanka Trump is facing criticism for a photo of herself hugging her son on Twitter.On Sunday, the 36-year-old White House adviser posted an image forehead-to-forehead with her two-year-old son, Theodore, on the social media site. While it seemed like a harmless photo, the picture hit nerves of many who were critical of President Donald Trump administration’s recent decision to separate immigrant families.On Sunday, after Trump’s tweet, standup comedian Patton Oswalt called out the fashion designer’s tweets.Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Chelsea Peretti also called Trump’s photo “hurtful timing.”Others, however, backed Trump’s photo, calling it beautiful, adding how it’s not the government’s (or her) fault families are being separated.While we don’t know the whether Trump had intentions behind the timing of the tweet, writer Arwa Mahdawi of the Guardian says it’s impossible the first daughter mistimed her tweet. “When Ivanka tweeted that photo on Sunday, I don’t think it was a gaffe – I think she knew exactly what she was doing. Which was playing to Trump’s specific base; reminding them that it’s white families like hers – like theirs – who are important, not the brown families who Trump is breaking up; using the image of herself as a loving mother to provide a human face to Trump’s inhumane administration,” she continued.And while she hasn’t said anything herself, Trump did post a tweet on Tuesday, telling users to ignore their trolls.
